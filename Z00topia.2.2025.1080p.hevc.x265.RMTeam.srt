Subtitles created by AZEVARJ FFC 1902.
Synced for DCP Webrip.

2
00:00:23,528 --> 00:00:24,528
OK.

3
00:00:24,863 --> 00:00:28,656
Sangue, sangue, sangue! E morte.

4
00:00:29,038 --> 00:00:30,154
Muito bem, sabe de uma coisa? Você está se aproveitando demais da situação.

5
00:00:30,307 --> 00:00:32,108
Além disso, acho que conseguimos. Acho que conseguimos.

6
00:00:32,218 --> 00:00:34,177
Conseguimos colocar lá em cima. Obrigado, Yakety-yak!

7
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:36,304
Você explicou tudo de forma brilhante.

8
00:00:36,343 --> 00:00:38,803
Eu emoldurei o Coração de Leão. Posso emoldurar você também.

9
00:00:39,236 --> 00:00:41,145
É a minha palavra contra a sua.

10
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:42,581
Na verdade...

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,209
<i>E eu vou dardejar todos os predadores de Zootopia para que continue assim.</i>

12
00:00:46,443 --> 00:00:48,079
É a sua palavra contra a sua.

13
00:00:49,026 --> 00:00:50,734
Isso se chama malandragem, querida.

14
00:00:51,074 --> 00:00:51,654
Boom.

15
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:58,453
Uma dupla improvável, Judy Hopps, a primeira policial coelha da cidade,

16
00:00:58,705 --> 00:01:01,342
e Nicholas Wilde, uma raposa de rua de pouca importância,

17
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:07,000
Hoje foi descoberta uma conspiração do prefeito Bellwether usando uma caneta gravadora em forma de cenoura de brinquedo.

18
00:01:07,045 --> 00:01:08,467
<i>Eu também posso te enquadrar.</i>

19
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,812
Mais tarde, Wilde também se juntou à ZPD, onde a dupla agora é a primeira...

20
00:01:17,863 --> 00:01:20,780
Dupla coelho-raposa na história de Zootopia.

21
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,467
O novo prefeito e ex-ator Brian Winddancer elogiou os dois.

22
00:01:26,492 --> 00:01:31,890
durante as comemorações do centenário da invenção das paredes climáticas de Zootopia

23
00:01:32,335 --> 00:01:37,054
que permitiu que todos os ambientes e todos os animais coexistissem em uma mesma cidade.

24
00:01:37,093 --> 00:01:39,680
Este é o nosso Zootennial.

25
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:45,279
E se um coelho humilde do campo e uma raposa astuta e provavelmente criminosa...

26
00:01:45,304 --> 00:01:51,460
podem ignorar suas imensas diferenças e acabar de vez com o preconceito e os estereótipos.

27
00:01:51,617 --> 00:01:55,193
então talvez todos possamos abraçar o nosso

28
00:01:55,218 --> 00:01:59,406
diferenças e ser melhor juntos.

29
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:02,953
Vamos desvendar um novo caso e tornar o mundo um lugar melhor.

30
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,140
E sejam os melhores parceiros de todos os tempos!

31
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:07,646
Quer dizer, não somos tão diferentes assim.

32
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:26,000
Na ZPD, a parceria é a pedra angular do sucesso.

33
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:28,054
Quer prender os bandidos?

34
00:02:28,444 --> 00:02:31,046
Estejam em sintonia todos os dias.

35
00:02:31,328 --> 00:02:34,662
O vilão de hoje é este inspetor alfandegário.

36
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:39,507
que tem contrabandeado carga ilegal do exterior através do estaleiro da cidade.

37
00:02:39,687 --> 00:02:42,795
Os capitães Hoggbottom e Truffler estarão no comando.

38
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,928
Higgins, Bloats, flanco esquerdo, Chèvre, Bücheron, direita,

39
00:02:46,953 --> 00:02:50,154
- e bem no meio, os Zebros. - Zebros!

40
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:52,717
Hopps e Wilde, eu sei que vocês estão ansiosos para provar o seu valor,

41
00:02:52,742 --> 00:02:58,703
Mas, como novatos, vocês apenas observarão e verão as equipes veteranas mostrarem como se faz.

42
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:01,318
Chefe, olá.

43
00:03:01,343 --> 00:03:02,867
Se você está procurando por Nick e Judy.

44
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:08,046
Eles disseram que conseguiram! E já estão no local com o bebê!

45
00:03:17,457 --> 00:03:18,646
Tem certeza de que isso vai funcionar?

46
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:20,445
Foi você quem disse que precisávamos de uma prisão.

47
00:03:20,546 --> 00:03:22,687
Apenas siga o meu exemplo, ok? Aja naturalmente.

48
00:03:22,742 --> 00:03:23,906
- Ei! - Vamos lá.

49
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:24,742
Olá!

50
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:27,698
Toda esta área é restrita. Você não pode estar aqui.

51
00:03:27,998 --> 00:03:29,953
Uau. Raposa e coelho.

52
00:03:30,054 --> 00:03:33,773
- Certo... - Sim, mas primeiro os pais orgulhosos, Sr...

53
00:03:33,812 --> 00:03:36,740
Inspetor. Inspetor Snootley.

54
00:03:36,765 --> 00:03:38,437
Inspetor?

55
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:39,484
O que você faz?

56
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:42,914
Garantir que nada ilegal seja contrabandeado para cá em um desses contêineres de carga?

57
00:03:43,664 --> 00:03:45,664
Essa é uma maneira estranha de perguntar isso.

58
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:46,886
Enfim, você precisa ir embora.

59
00:03:46,911 --> 00:03:48,031
Você não pode estar aqui!

60
00:03:48,056 --> 00:03:50,203
- Ah... - Espere. Espere.

61
00:03:50,601 --> 00:03:52,004
Ele tem razão, droga!

62
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,134
O senhor tem razão.

63
00:03:54,578 --> 00:03:56,953
Acho que devíamos ter pensado melhor nisso. Não é, amor?

64
00:03:57,929 --> 00:04:04,570
Antes de decidirmos vir até este belo estaleiro industrial,

65
00:04:04,664 --> 00:04:10,218
Para celebrar o grande dia do nosso aniversariante.

66
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,875
É aniversário dele?

67
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:14,898
Sim, o primeiro desde...

68
00:04:16,095 --> 00:04:17,495
Desde o acidente.

69
00:04:19,695 --> 00:04:21,921
E sabe qual era o único desejo desse pestinha?

70
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,937
aside from one day getting his tail reattached, yeah,

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,843
was to see a choo-choo.

72
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,616
And to maybe get a toot-toot conductor to sign his cast.

73
00:04:31,695 --> 00:04:37,179
But I'm betting a customs inspector would be even better.

74
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,007
Really?

75
00:04:38,843 --> 00:04:39,982
All right. For the kid.

76
00:04:40,007 --> 00:04:42,671
- For the kid. - Oh, you're a saint!

77
00:04:42,874 --> 00:04:44,146
We thank you so much. Here you go.

78
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:47,023
Either leg. Or both! I don't care.

79
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:49,624
Maybe put a doodle on it. Doesn't need to be perfect.

80
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:51,244
He's also legally blind.

81
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:59,921
I put a little train there because I know you like trains.

82
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:01,129
Come on, come on, come on.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,351
- Just, jiggle it... - Yes, I know.

84
00:05:03,376 --> 00:05:04,429
- Hurry! - I got this.

85
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,306
Jiggle it, jiggle it, jiggle it!

86
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:07,886
<i>Hopps and Wilde!</i>

87
00:05:07,937 --> 00:05:09,410
<i>You are not authorized!</i>

88
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,594
<i>Stand down and wait for backup!</i>

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,148
- Toot-toot. - It's the fuzz!

90
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,335
Stop! Stop in the name of the law!

91
00:05:20,496 --> 00:05:21,835
Everybody, run!

92
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,296
Well, can't win 'em all.

93
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,060
Get outta the road, you dumb bunny!

94
00:05:29,517 --> 00:05:30,637
Agree to disagree.

95
00:05:31,882 --> 00:05:33,268
My hog rod!

96
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:35,632
This is a snoutrage!

97
00:05:38,274 --> 00:05:42,796
Hopps and Wilde in pursuit of suspect in a stolen catering van heading east-

98
00:05:42,852 --> 00:05:46,052
Stop it! Heading east through Sheepshire.

99
00:05:59,822 --> 00:06:00,742
Beautiful!

100
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:02,450
I'll have what he's having.

101
00:06:02,658 --> 00:06:06,252
Darlin', I believe your driving's giving me some white hairs.

102
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,039
Also, am I always gonna be in the passenger seat?

103
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:12,671
- Cause if we're establishing sides- - Back off, rookies!

104
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,515
Let the real teams handle it!

105
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,125
Ma'am, we are a real team.

106
00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:18,531
Shortcut, take the tunnel.

107
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,359
Stand down, noobs.

108
00:06:30,384 --> 00:06:32,304
We got him. Rolling spikes!

109
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:33,626
Rolling spikes.

110
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,696
I hate that dumb bunny.

111
00:07:08,866 --> 00:07:10,062
I'm gonna jump.

112
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:11,593
No, no, no, what, what are you, you can't.

113
00:07:11,618 --> 00:07:13,817
Hey, I would like to call a partner meeting!

114
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,807
You can't-

115
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,367
Judy!

116
00:07:25,741 --> 00:07:28,093
Please, join me in a moment of silence

117
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:31,984
for our beloved weather wall inventor, Ebenezer Lynxley.

118
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,867
Zebros!

119
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:54,398
Reptile.

120
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,460
Zootopia ain't just a mammal city.

121
00:08:03,907 --> 00:08:07,903
It has a secret tiny reptile population.

122
00:08:08,403 --> 00:08:10,083
The most live abroad.

123
00:08:10,294 --> 00:08:13,334
Of course, Zootopia does not allow snakes.

124
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:18,225
Ain't been one of those around here for at least 100 years.

125
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,212
Scales and Tales of the Weird!

126
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:26,507
Yeah, not sure Nibbles Maplestick is our most reliable source.

127
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:29,541
Bunny, orange dog, in here now.

128
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:33,843
Sir, today may not have been ideal, but the anteater was captured.

129
00:08:33,874 --> 00:08:36,259
- By the Zebros! - Zebros!

130
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:38,195
- Shut it! - Zebros.

131
00:08:38,756 --> 00:08:39,554
It was us.

132
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:43,825
But more importantly, I believe we may have made a significant discovery.

133
00:08:44,071 --> 00:08:48,750
The stolen van contained a smuggled crate from overseas, pamphlets for the Zootennial

134
00:08:48,805 --> 00:08:50,748
and some type of reptile skin.

135
00:08:50,773 --> 00:08:52,515
I've already sent samples for testing. And-

136
00:08:52,547 --> 00:08:54,898
What needs testing is you!

137
00:08:54,982 --> 00:08:57,351
You two tore up half the city!

138
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:02,189
Because of you, we had to call in Jumbo Unit to remove a dik-dik from a tuba!

139
00:09:02,214 --> 00:09:04,835
- You're almost out! - Please help! Please help!

140
00:09:05,775 --> 00:09:07,710
- Who's catching him? - Sorry,

141
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:09,093
could you show me that clip again?

142
00:09:09,118 --> 00:09:10,593
Wasn't wearing my glasses.

143
00:09:10,898 --> 00:09:15,033
Did you or did you not disobey a direct order to stand down?

144
00:09:15,073 --> 00:09:19,171
Sir, we were in pursuit, and Article 6, Paragraph B states if the lead officer-

145
00:09:19,202 --> 00:09:21,576
You are not lead officers!

146
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:26,320
You're one-hit wonders who should go back to meter maiding and slinging popsicles!

147
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:30,822
If I may, I think someone's just jealous that we got to drive the squeal mobile.

148
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:33,757
Or maybe you thought it was your mama.

149
00:09:33,975 --> 00:09:36,479
Enough! Everybody, out!

150
00:09:41,842 --> 00:09:45,539
Officer Hopps, despite my best efforts to avoid it,

151
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:47,290
I like you.

152
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:52,445
But this need to overdo it

153
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,500
made both of you a headline today.

154
00:09:56,175 --> 00:10:02,546
And it reflects badly on me, on the department, and frankly, on any bunny

155
00:10:02,609 --> 00:10:05,460
hoping to follow in your footsteps.

156
00:10:07,448 --> 00:10:10,421
Not every case is going to save the world.

157
00:10:12,063 --> 00:10:12,769
Knock, knock.

158
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:14,257
Hi.

159
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:18,578
You know this kinda, this sounds a lot like a, just a you guys conversation.

160
00:10:18,603 --> 00:10:19,835
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead-

161
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,171
Is there a reason why you don't take anything seriously?

162
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:26,109
Jokes are a classic defense mechanism for someone with a traumatic childhood.

163
00:10:26,134 --> 00:10:28,188
Would you like a traumatic adulthood?

164
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:29,781
I would not.

165
00:10:29,882 --> 00:10:34,213
I allowed you to work together because you did this city a great service.

166
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:37,758
But today you messed it all up.

167
00:10:37,783 --> 00:10:41,116
And now, some are questioning whether you should have been partners

168
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,109
- in the first place. - But, sir...

169
00:10:42,134 --> 00:10:47,215
So instead of chasing imaginary reptiles, I am pulling you from the field.

170
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,874
- What? - And giving you a new assignment

171
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:53,382
reserved for special teams like yourselves.

172
00:10:53,661 --> 00:10:58,806
Fail at this, and I will have no choice but to split you up.

173
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,813
There will be no more Hopps and Wilde.

174
00:11:01,872 --> 00:11:08,763
But if you're good as you think you are, this is your moment to shine.

175
00:11:11,381 --> 00:11:17,620
Welcome to Partners in Crisis, a workshop for duos heading for disaster.

176
00:11:18,204 --> 00:11:22,306
I'm your therapy animal, Dr. Fuzzby, and you are here because

177
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:27,384
mismatched pairings often need a little more work to make them work.

178
00:11:27,798 --> 00:11:30,079
Greg? We talked about that.

179
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:32,845
What are we making Marlon? Uncomfortable.

180
00:11:33,183 --> 00:11:33,853
Yes.

181
00:11:34,797 --> 00:11:39,275
And Francine, Clark may be a mouse, but he is your partner first.

182
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,111
And we have two new partners.

183
00:11:43,618 --> 00:11:47,525
Can you tell us about your journey to dysfunction junction?

184
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:53,611
Well, we've been official partners for one week, happy anniversary.

185
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:56,853
And we are not dysfunctional at all, actually.

186
00:11:56,923 --> 00:11:58,650
Functioning fine, better than fine.

187
00:11:58,853 --> 00:12:00,882
And we did sorta save the city.

188
00:12:00,907 --> 00:12:04,579
So, us being here kinda seems like a huge misunderstanding.

189
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:08,695
Notice how she answered first, did not allow her partner to speak,

190
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,656
seems to be in a state of denial, and taps her foot

191
00:12:10,681 --> 00:12:12,392
when she's suppressing discomfort.

192
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:15,236
And observe the source of her discomfort,

193
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,449
represented by the disconnected affectation

194
00:12:17,474 --> 00:12:19,438
of her emotionally insecure partner.

195
00:12:20,103 --> 00:12:23,780
But with hard work, they'll be on the same page by year two!

196
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:27,462
But for now, let's begin by greeting our teammate.

197
00:12:27,673 --> 00:12:30,087
Who'd like to go first? Thank you, Joel.

198
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,023
Okay, unfortunately, Karen has chosen

199
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:38,907
to see Joel's smile as a sign of aggression.

200
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:40,462
Hackles down, Karen.

201
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,070
Karen, hackles down.

202
00:12:42,103 --> 00:12:44,023
Joel, the safe word is "coconut!"

203
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:45,236
Coconut!

204
00:12:47,454 --> 00:12:50,126
Okay, we have to set another meeting with the chief.

205
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,570
Promise we'll be better.

206
00:12:52,937 --> 00:12:54,121
Zebros...

207
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,184
You talk back less. Maybe not at all.

208
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:01,101
Yeah, or we go with my playbook and we just lay low.

209
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:04,306
We cannot prove ourselves if we are stuck in that room.

210
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:07,212
And if we complain to Chief Beef, he'll just make us stay longer.

211
00:13:07,314 --> 00:13:10,775
Play it smart, stay off the radar, and don't let it get to you, okay?

212
00:13:10,854 --> 00:13:13,306
Cause we are the dream team.

213
00:13:15,803 --> 00:13:16,883
Sorry, Paul.

214
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:21,589
Oh, roll out the red carpet.

215
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:22,949
Here's the Supercops.

216
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,181
Wait, hey, what does the fox say?

217
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,525
- You suck. - Easy, partner.

218
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,118
Let me ask you something.

219
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,687
- Do you think we're a good team? - Of course.

220
00:13:32,203 --> 00:13:37,142
I just... I just wish I knew what we had to do to prove it to everyone else.

221
00:13:37,235 --> 00:13:40,501
Or maybe we don't have to prove anything to anybody.

222
00:13:43,582 --> 00:13:44,329
We do.

223
00:13:44,748 --> 00:13:45,478
Forever.

224
00:13:46,103 --> 00:13:49,721
And the sooner everyone sees a fox and a bunny can be great partners, the better.

225
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:51,478
Enjoy it. I got two.

226
00:13:51,503 --> 00:13:53,173
I'd rather chew off my own arm.

227
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:54,628
Happy anniversary!

228
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,501
Coconut! Coconut!

229
00:14:29,606 --> 00:14:32,704
So, saw you on TV. You okay?

230
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:34,988
- Everything's fine, Mom. - Uh-oh.

231
00:14:35,013 --> 00:14:36,893
Everyone knows fine is a cry for help.

232
00:14:37,037 --> 00:14:38,317
You know who else cried for help?

233
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:39,868
That dik-dik stuck in that tuba.

234
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:41,212
Oh, him and the dik-dik.

235
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,775
What does your fox partner say?

236
00:14:42,808 --> 00:14:46,697
Well, Nick's not really a talker.

237
00:14:47,296 --> 00:14:49,820
Well, you two are very different.

238
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:52,064
Small town hero, raised on a farm.

239
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:54,040
Big city crook, raised on the streets.

240
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,532
I pray every day that you'll

241
00:14:55,557 --> 00:14:57,603
- come back home and make babies. - Mom!

242
00:14:57,628 --> 00:14:59,490
Just remember the first rule of partnerships.

243
00:14:59,606 --> 00:15:02,400
- You can be right or you can be happy. - That's true.

244
00:15:02,425 --> 00:15:05,439
There's nothing wrong with dying a little inside so you can meet in the middle.

245
00:15:05,464 --> 00:15:06,759
Honey, you're pushing me out.

246
00:15:06,784 --> 00:15:07,782
I want to make sure I can be seen.

247
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,541
- Well, if she could see both of us. - Okay, gotta go!

248
00:15:09,566 --> 00:15:10,716
- Work to do. - Bye, bun-bun.

249
00:15:10,741 --> 00:15:11,907
Everything's gonna be fine.

250
00:15:11,987 --> 00:15:13,923
- You two just need a new case. - Got it. Love you!

251
00:15:13,948 --> 00:15:15,767
- Hey, maybe try to find that dik-dik! - Bye!

252
00:15:26,063 --> 00:15:28,439
Ding-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding! Gering-ding-

253
00:15:28,642 --> 00:15:30,759
Squeal of Fortune!

254
00:15:30,853 --> 00:15:33,564
Tomorrow's weather is, again, everything!

255
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:38,219
To announce that the long-awaited Tundratown expansion will be starting soon.

256
00:15:38,307 --> 00:15:42,213
Residents continue to raise concerns about the future of their neighborhood.

257
00:15:42,422 --> 00:15:48,189
But tonight, we put our differences aside and celebrate at the Zootennial Gala,

258
00:15:48,236 --> 00:15:51,306
where the Lynxley Journal will be on display for the first time

259
00:15:51,331 --> 00:15:55,197
in a century, following an infamous reptile attack.

260
00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:59,212
The Lynxley Journal, containing the patented weather wall plans,

261
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,636
was originally written by Ebenezer Lynxley, bringing the whole-

262
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,415
Same catering company.

263
00:16:32,248 --> 00:16:33,954
The Lynxley Journal.

264
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:43,285
Truth bomb!

265
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:47,868
The 100th anniversary of the weather walls is also the 100th anniversary

266
00:16:47,915 --> 00:16:50,486
of Zootopia's only snake attack.

267
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:52,720
The victim? A tortoise.

268
00:16:52,973 --> 00:16:57,639
The Lynxley family maid, who was fanged while stopping

269
00:16:57,664 --> 00:17:01,040
a venomous snake from stealing the Lynxley Journal.

270
00:17:01,446 --> 00:17:07,806
No one has seen a snake in Zootopia since, but I'm convinced one will return.

271
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:14,368
My only question is, is he going to be wearing half a pants or one long sock?

272
00:17:19,475 --> 00:17:22,017
You say justice is dead.

273
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:24,504
I say, neigh!

274
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:31,100
Well, well, you missed me already, huh?

275
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,590
The stolen van with the snake skin

276
00:17:32,615 --> 00:17:34,970
is from the same catering company that's working the gala.

277
00:17:35,392 --> 00:17:38,375
- This is you studying your partner book? - Listen to me.

278
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,275
Venomous snakes tried to steal the Lynxley's journal before.

279
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:43,400
What if they're back in town to steal it again?

280
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,111
No snake has set foot in Zootopia in forever.

281
00:17:47,136 --> 00:17:48,775
Okay? Even if they had feet.

282
00:17:49,258 --> 00:17:50,613
Look, we're already in the hot seat, Carrots.

283
00:17:50,638 --> 00:17:52,064
And pizza's here. Gotta go-

284
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,260
If there's a fanging at the gala and we do nothing to stop it,

285
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:56,020
then we are not doing our jobs.

286
00:17:56,382 --> 00:17:57,001
Yikes.

287
00:17:57,103 --> 00:17:59,056
No wonder you never invite me over.

288
00:17:59,129 --> 00:18:00,445
Foxes are solitary.

289
00:18:00,773 --> 00:18:04,220
And look, we go and you're wrong, Chief Beef will split us up.

290
00:18:04,245 --> 00:18:06,486
And if we don't get a win soon and prove we're great partners,

291
00:18:06,557 --> 00:18:08,436
the chief will split us up anyway.

292
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,165
Check the perimeter, snoop a little.

293
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:11,606
We find nothing, we bail.

294
00:18:12,051 --> 00:18:16,251
But if I'm right, no one will question whether you and I belong together again.

295
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,200
We need this.

296
00:18:19,939 --> 00:18:20,919
Fine.

297
00:18:21,204 --> 00:18:23,234
But we'll still have to get through security.

298
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:26,861
And in fancy town, a fox and a bunny won't exactly blend in.

299
00:18:27,157 --> 00:18:29,478
That's why we'll be undercover!

300
00:18:33,668 --> 00:18:35,056
See, you're still in the driver's seat.

321
00:19:50,298 --> 00:19:52,204
Mayor Winddancer has arrived.

322
00:19:52,904 --> 00:19:57,126
- Star of the Revenge Trilogy, The Neighsayer. - No pictures, please.

323
00:19:57,978 --> 00:20:01,554
Come on. And that, and that one, and then this one.

324
00:20:01,582 --> 00:20:04,593
Mr. Lynxley, Mr. Lynxley! When will you begin the Tundratown expansion?

325
00:20:04,618 --> 00:20:06,959
- Come on, Dad. - Have a wonderful time at the party.

328
00:20:28,951 --> 00:20:30,266
No snow.

329
00:20:31,714 --> 00:20:32,934
This one's warmer.

330
00:20:33,341 --> 00:20:36,445
Reptile in Tundratown might need that to survive the cold.

331
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,193
Oh my God, a viper!

332
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:43,151
A window viper. Yeah?

333
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:49,175
Backdoor ajar.

334
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,974
Anyone could have left it like that.

335
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:53,470
And you said snoop a little, not break and ent-

336
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:57,005
Oh, we were always going inside. Got it.

337
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,571
Same page means your page.

338
00:20:58,596 --> 00:21:00,080
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.

339
00:21:00,104 --> 00:21:01,799
You change out here. I get the van.

340
00:21:18,982 --> 00:21:22,088
It's the Zootennial Gala, a bunny comes prepared.

341
00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:28,078
You know I used to dream of infiltrating a place like this.

342
00:21:34,764 --> 00:21:38,050
You know, this is not your worst idea.

343
00:21:38,604 --> 00:21:40,410
Wow, that was almost a compliment.

344
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,868
Your worst idea is what you did with your ears.

345
00:21:44,746 --> 00:21:45,520
Alright.

346
00:21:57,714 --> 00:22:04,681
Welcome to the Zootennial Gala. Featuring the original Lynxley Journal.

347
00:22:04,767 --> 00:22:08,730
Why would a snake want to steal some old book anyway?

348
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:10,019
I don't know.

349
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:15,250
But no one is gonna steal it because we are here to protect it.

350
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:20,798
The journal is in the reserved section.

351
00:22:21,546 --> 00:22:22,108
Okay.

352
00:22:23,582 --> 00:22:25,439
- Come on. - Slow down.

353
00:22:25,518 --> 00:22:29,011
You want to fit in? Commando is not gonna cut it.

354
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:31,103
It's not just the clothes, mkay?

355
00:22:31,314 --> 00:22:32,925
It is the vibe.

356
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:34,221
Good to see ya.

357
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,544
Hey, real nice humps.

358
00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:38,103
Oh, is that real mink? It's real fox.

359
00:22:39,032 --> 00:22:40,775
Get invited to a lot of these?

360
00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:43,142
Invited? No.

361
00:22:43,171 --> 00:22:45,414
But there's other reasons to hobnob.

362
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:49,759
Madam, excuse me. Is this yours?

363
00:22:49,784 --> 00:22:51,275
Why, yes.

364
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,840
Well, allow me.

365
00:22:55,796 --> 00:22:58,618
Clever fox. Ooh, there.

366
00:23:00,064 --> 00:23:01,923
I don't think it has enough guards.

367
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,568
I'll get a closer look. Watch my six.

368
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:12,486
Bogo-alert.

369
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,822
Cover's made of metal.

370
00:23:27,895 --> 00:23:31,329
Gruffalo Buffalo has joined the mix. Three o'clock.

371
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,853
- Oh, excuse me. - Oh no, sorry.

372
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,611
- I am so sorry. - Here, let me just, oh nope-

373
00:23:44,848 --> 00:23:47,144
That belongs to you. I apologize.

374
00:23:48,037 --> 00:23:49,523
Oh gosh, he hates me.

375
00:23:49,618 --> 00:23:52,001
- Here. - Ah, you're my hero.

376
00:23:52,176 --> 00:23:55,423
Well, I just like to be prepared for any possible scenario.

377
00:23:55,859 --> 00:23:58,095
Which is not a weird thing to say at a party.

378
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:01,651
Well, I just mopped a spill with that guy's tail, so...

379
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:03,287
Paw!

380
00:24:04,685 --> 00:24:07,243
Uh, Pawbert! I am Pawbert! Hi.

381
00:24:07,591 --> 00:24:11,185
- Judy. I'm Judy Hopps. - Ah, what the pork?

382
00:24:11,218 --> 00:24:13,236
Well, 'tis nice to meet you Judy-

383
00:24:13,261 --> 00:24:15,493
Wait, Judy Hopps, the Judy Hopps?

384
00:24:16,191 --> 00:24:17,353
Are you working this?

385
00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:19,239
I mean, you're clearly working it.

386
00:24:19,698 --> 00:24:21,318
But are you actually working this?

387
00:24:21,977 --> 00:24:23,626
Uh, no. I'm actually-

388
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:24,915
Well, it's just a hunch.

389
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:26,501
Protecting that.

390
00:24:27,326 --> 00:24:30,272
Good. I don't think it has enough guards.

391
00:24:30,371 --> 00:24:31,657
<i>Uh, that was my joke.</i>

392
00:24:31,907 --> 00:24:33,524
<i>And you know...</i> And there's nothing here.

393
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,934
Let's call it a night. Hopps?

394
00:24:42,512 --> 00:24:43,503
Well, we should...

395
00:24:43,771 --> 00:24:45,017
It was nice to meet you.

396
00:24:45,098 --> 00:24:46,247
Yes, and you,

397
00:24:46,288 --> 00:24:47,530
Uh, bon appétit!

398
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:51,368
If at any point tonight you choose to eat, bon appétit then.

399
00:24:52,014 --> 00:24:54,181
You're supposed to be off stage, Pawbert.

400
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:57,157
- Yeah, get off stage, Pawbert. - Wait are-

401
00:24:57,182 --> 00:25:00,195
- Are you? - Yeah, I am a Lynxley.

402
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,782
Or, you know, I'm trying to be.

403
00:25:01,807 --> 00:25:03,882
Now, Pawbert. Come on, Pappy.

404
00:25:03,907 --> 00:25:05,704
- I got you, Pa, don't you worry. - No, I have him.

405
00:25:05,829 --> 00:25:06,392
I have him.

406
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:09,048
All right, let's get this thing started.

407
00:25:13,618 --> 00:25:16,712
- Welcome to the Zootennial Gala. - Hey, Hopps.

408
00:25:16,822 --> 00:25:18,470
I think I might actually...

409
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,770
I think I've got something!

410
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,259
Look at you all.

411
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,449
Good to see you.

412
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:28,712
It is with great pleasure that I introduce the third generation...

413
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:31,085
Carrots, can you hear me? I have a trail.

414
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:35,532
-the legacy of our great city, Milton Lynxley!

415
00:25:35,696 --> 00:25:37,501
- Thank you. Thank you - Carrots.

416
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,861
- very much. - Carrots!

417
00:25:40,425 --> 00:25:41,711
What are you doing here?

418
00:25:41,736 --> 00:25:44,165
- Chief, she was right. - You're done.

419
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:45,204
You're both done.

420
00:25:45,229 --> 00:25:48,001
My grandpa had a dream to build

421
00:25:48,026 --> 00:25:49,900
- a city for all of us... - Nick?

422
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:54,954
To truly be better together.

423
00:26:05,391 --> 00:26:06,674
There's a snake!

424
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:08,228
Snake, snake, snake!

425
00:26:08,812 --> 00:26:09,812
Go, go, go!

426
00:26:10,107 --> 00:26:12,023
I will remember you, zebra!

427
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:37,064
Judy! Judy!

428
00:26:42,665 --> 00:26:43,431
I knew it!

429
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:02,844
Stop!

430
00:27:04,404 --> 00:27:06,509
Please, you don't have to hurt him.

431
00:27:08,157 --> 00:27:09,133
Hurt him?

432
00:27:10,023 --> 00:27:13,708
Snakes never hurt anyone.

433
00:27:14,355 --> 00:27:16,111
We aren't the bad guys.

434
00:27:16,722 --> 00:27:17,694
They are.

435
00:27:19,248 --> 00:27:23,720
And this journal holds the secret that will prove it.

436
00:27:24,622 --> 00:27:28,664
I have to prove it. Please.

437
00:27:30,747 --> 00:27:33,587
This is our only chance to set things right.

438
00:27:34,347 --> 00:27:40,529
And when I do, my family will finally be able to come home.

439
00:27:41,933 --> 00:27:42,875
Oh no!

440
00:27:43,252 --> 00:27:44,121
I am here!

441
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:47,564
Hopps and Wilde, dream team. We got him.

442
00:27:47,785 --> 00:27:50,525
Or her. Reptiles, it's like, who knows?

443
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:53,900
The cops are right behind us.

444
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:56,938
Kill the snake.

445
00:27:57,086 --> 00:27:58,262
We'll burn the journal.

446
00:27:58,403 --> 00:28:00,723
If he wants it, it's dangerous.

447
00:28:01,707 --> 00:28:06,195
And then you two will file a report that he attacked us

448
00:28:06,358 --> 00:28:09,588
and you will keep your mouths shut.

449
00:28:12,337 --> 00:28:13,727
Step aside.

450
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:19,330
Put out the fire!

451
00:28:20,361 --> 00:28:21,986
- Carrots, come on! - Help me save him!

452
00:28:22,011 --> 00:28:23,212
- Carrots, we need- - Nick!

453
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,072
Cold! Cold!

454
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:34,583
Chief.

455
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,119
He'll be okay. Anti-venom.

456
00:28:37,144 --> 00:28:39,236
- He can be saved with anti-venom. - Hopps!

457
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,939
What did you do?

458
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:42,743
- Hoggbottom! - They're helping the snake!

459
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:43,728
They're trying to kill the chief!

460
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:45,134
Hoggbottom, no, please-

461
00:28:45,197 --> 00:28:48,172
- My page. Let's go. - Wait, wait, wait, I need the journal!

462
00:28:48,197 --> 00:28:49,673
And probably a sweater!

463
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,189
Cold!

464
00:29:01,433 --> 00:29:03,993
- Next time, we stay home? - Don't you...

465
00:29:07,949 --> 00:29:09,368
No, stop them!

466
00:29:09,393 --> 00:29:11,150
- Oi! Wait! - Come on, come on.

467
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:12,939
Stop!

468
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:20,556
- <i>I really am just a dumb bunny.</i> - Accident.

469
00:29:20,683 --> 00:29:22,168
Your words, not mine.

470
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,269
Put 'em in the trunk.

471
00:29:34,015 --> 00:29:34,483
What?

472
00:29:45,077 --> 00:29:47,720
Ter-roar in Tundratown!

473
00:29:47,768 --> 00:29:49,095
A fanging at the fiesta.

474
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:53,881
A hooowl at the gala as a venomous snake attacks the founding family.

475
00:29:54,023 --> 00:29:57,260
More shocking, the snake was aided by embattled ZPD officers

476
00:29:57,317 --> 00:29:59,306
Nicholas Wilde and Judy Hopps.

477
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,736
All three now suspects in the tragic fanging of Zootopia's chief of police

478
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,870
and considered extremely dangerous.

479
00:30:07,029 --> 00:30:10,619
Chief Bogo is dead.

480
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,501
Those are words I'm glad I don't have to say.

481
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:16,725
I might have to soon

482
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:21,111
the doctor's a little weirded out, but what has happened tonight

483
00:30:21,531 --> 00:30:23,271
was more than horseplay!

484
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:31,945
We're gonna take that snake down.

485
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:35,070
And the fox and that rabbit.

486
00:30:36,443 --> 00:30:39,983
Do you know how many mayors they've already destroyed?

487
00:30:41,938 --> 00:30:44,296
One... Two...

488
00:30:44,907 --> 00:30:46,096
I got up to two.

489
00:30:46,193 --> 00:30:48,310
Would you like to be three?

490
00:30:49,363 --> 00:30:51,870
I want them gone.

491
00:30:52,738 --> 00:30:56,399
But aren't there laws?

492
00:30:56,935 --> 00:31:01,120
I will say this once, Brian.

493
00:31:01,497 --> 00:31:06,204
You will retrieve the journal and bury them.

494
00:31:07,612 --> 00:31:11,250
Or maybe I chose the wrong mayor.

495
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:16,304
Did I choose the wrong mayor?

496
00:32:05,915 --> 00:32:09,611
Hey. The phone is the first thing they'll track.

497
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:11,712
Sorry.

498
00:32:11,743 --> 00:32:16,329
I have never been on the run from the law before.

499
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:17,634
Yeah, boy.

500
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,892
It's almost like we shouldn't have gone to that gala.

501
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,376
Okey-doke, we already did it your way.

502
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,790
With Mr. Big, we do it mine.

503
00:32:25,851 --> 00:32:29,853
This is where having a partner from the underworld is really gonna pay off.

504
00:32:30,609 --> 00:32:32,751
Raymond! And is that Kev-

505
00:32:56,777 --> 00:32:59,142
Welcome to my warehouse!

506
00:32:59,513 --> 00:33:00,962
Oh my God, I love your dress!

507
00:33:01,018 --> 00:33:02,636
Oh, thank you.

508
00:33:03,677 --> 00:33:07,322
Fru Fru and I are now equal partners in the family business.

509
00:33:07,743 --> 00:33:11,657
She brings wonderful ideas for crime and for fashion

510
00:33:11,965 --> 00:33:16,145
while I get more time to focus on what matters most,

511
00:33:16,624 --> 00:33:19,361
being grandpapa to my little Judith.

512
00:33:19,495 --> 00:33:21,392
Kiss my ring.

513
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:24,468
- Kiss the stinking ring right now! Kiss it! - Kiss it right now! Kiss it!

514
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:30,876
Nonno, you said we were gonna make some nice shoes for Mr. Weaselton.

515
00:33:30,955 --> 00:33:33,939
- That's my girl! - They grow up so fast.

516
00:33:33,964 --> 00:33:35,853
- You run your mouth too much! - Shut your mouth, fox!

517
00:33:37,389 --> 00:33:43,056
Anyways, you're in trouble, and we like... one of yous, so we're here to help.

518
00:33:43,214 --> 00:33:47,522
New clothes, new identities, truck out of town, leave in an hour,

519
00:33:47,565 --> 00:33:49,775
and your meter maid car is taken care of.

520
00:33:53,384 --> 00:33:54,952
I think you misunderstand.

521
00:33:55,231 --> 00:33:58,306
We've been framed by the lynxes and an innocent snake-

522
00:33:58,331 --> 00:34:04,070
Judy, the lynxes are killers, and they have no honor.

523
00:34:04,253 --> 00:34:08,689
And this Tundratown expansion only makes them more dangerous.

524
00:34:08,903 --> 00:34:12,912
Territorial animals will do anything for more land.

525
00:34:13,173 --> 00:34:17,993
So if whatever you're tangled up in threatens their plans, you're dead.

526
00:34:18,327 --> 00:34:20,007
You don't fight the cats.

527
00:34:20,252 --> 00:34:21,652
You leave.

528
00:34:21,806 --> 00:34:26,118
Sir, I know you're trying to look out for us, but we took an oath

529
00:34:26,151 --> 00:34:29,516
to protect this city, and justice doesn't run!

530
00:34:29,563 --> 00:34:34,907
On behalf of myself, Rick Wilde and Ms. Trudy Cabbagepatch.

531
00:34:35,022 --> 00:34:37,040
We thank you for your truck to salvation.

532
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,697
We cannot accept your offer.

533
00:34:38,722 --> 00:34:39,962
We are helping that snake.

534
00:34:40,426 --> 00:34:42,226
Boy, you're really tossing that 'we' around.

535
00:34:42,252 --> 00:34:45,120
Snakes may have been framed for the fanging of that tortoise.

536
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:49,095
Do you have any idea why or how this book could prove it?

537
00:34:49,145 --> 00:34:50,808
I wish I did.

538
00:34:51,045 --> 00:34:56,657
But if it has to do with snakes, your best bet is talking to a reptile.

539
00:34:57,144 --> 00:34:58,825
Do you know any?

540
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,720
Almost no one does.

541
00:35:01,005 --> 00:35:04,915
They keep to themselves, hide out in Marsh Market.

542
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,072
But you can still find them.

543
00:35:07,127 --> 00:35:12,126
You just need a reptile expert, someone local who knows where to go.

544
00:35:12,189 --> 00:35:14,243
Lucky for you, I met someone.

545
00:35:14,289 --> 00:35:16,242
She runs a podcast.

546
00:35:16,505 --> 00:35:17,202
No, no.

547
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:18,337
Trudy Cabbagepatch.

548
00:35:18,362 --> 00:35:20,361
Rick Wilde says no.

549
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:22,942
Oh, yeah!

550
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,462
Hopps and Wilde are on the lam.

551
00:35:26,546 --> 00:35:29,611
Subtle sleuthing, 'tis my jam!

552
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:32,814
Mind the splinters. Oh, you called the right beaver.

553
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:36,040
If you want to talk to a reptile, I am your gal.

554
00:35:36,096 --> 00:35:40,773
Also, if you need to talk to a jackalope, which are real, Mom!

555
00:35:41,555 --> 00:35:43,157
Excuse us. Team meeting.

556
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:45,585
Vetoing the beave, new vote,

557
00:35:45,634 --> 00:35:49,099
all in favor of 'truck to being alive and laying low till this blows over'-bill?

558
00:35:49,775 --> 00:35:50,236
I mean...

559
00:35:50,261 --> 00:35:52,152
Hopps and Wilde do not bail on a case.

560
00:35:52,196 --> 00:35:53,126
But she's crazy.

561
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:55,954
Probably lead poisoning from eating too many pencils.

562
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:01,073
Do you know a reptile who can tell us the hidden secret in here

563
00:36:01,098 --> 00:36:02,564
why the lynxes framed the snakes?

564
00:36:04,568 --> 00:36:06,910
24 hours. Sunrise tomorrow.

565
00:36:06,935 --> 00:36:11,110
If we strike out, then we go into hiding, and Judy Cabbagepatch it is.

566
00:36:12,757 --> 00:36:16,111
It's Trudy Cabbagepatch, and the safe word is "coconut."

567
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:20,040
In the darkness, of a dank underpass, they stepped into the vehicle

568
00:36:20,113 --> 00:36:23,326
not realizing their lives were about to change.

569
00:36:23,758 --> 00:36:25,665
Because we're gonna meet a reptile?

570
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:30,993
Because you're about to be best buds with Nibbles Maplestick!

571
00:36:31,207 --> 00:36:34,915
Takes two to tango, but a threesome to be somethin'!

572
00:36:34,955 --> 00:36:38,448
Let's find you a reptile and rock the swamp!

573
00:36:46,561 --> 00:36:48,520
Breathe it in!

574
00:36:53,514 --> 00:36:56,126
Now if any reptile would know the secret of that book

575
00:36:56,151 --> 00:36:57,445
and why the snake wants it-

576
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,083
Hey, Johnny.

577
00:36:59,523 --> 00:37:01,821
It's my lizard friend Jesús.

578
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:05,043
Why would a lizard hide here?

579
00:37:06,754 --> 00:37:10,072
Well, when Zootopia was founded, the whole neighborhood

580
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,764
got cut off from the rest of the town.

581
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,032
Kind of on our own here.

582
00:37:14,481 --> 00:37:16,616
Yeah, it's probably why reptiles like it.

583
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,480
They can just do their thing.

584
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,620
Plus, it's the only place in town you can get away with

585
00:37:20,653 --> 00:37:22,759
wearing a shirt and no pants.

586
00:37:23,014 --> 00:37:25,872
Loving tour time with Woodchuckles. Great call.

587
00:37:26,592 --> 00:37:28,197
- We need her. - Oh, yeah.

588
00:37:28,253 --> 00:37:31,389
Like a hole in the head. Bad timing.

589
00:37:32,642 --> 00:37:36,225
Okay, to get to Jesús' hideout, we gotta take a ferry.

590
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:37,874
Just let me handle the locals.

591
00:37:37,916 --> 00:37:40,582
Water folk tend to be a little stand-offish around landies.

592
00:37:40,684 --> 00:37:43,084
Well, I've been hustling the streets since I was twelve.

593
00:37:43,282 --> 00:37:45,617
I think I can handle a juggling seal.

594
00:37:47,692 --> 00:37:49,214
Sea lion.

595
00:37:49,281 --> 00:37:50,665
He's not from around here.

596
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:51,905
But coin's a coin.

597
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:53,797
Oh, no, change...

598
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,965
...is a choking hazard.

599
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,471
Well, honest mistake.

600
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,725
Do not do that!

601
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,190
Let's let Nibbles handle this.

602
00:38:02,332 --> 00:38:03,911
Thank you, Judith.

603
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:06,445
Conversing with these beautiful sea creatures

604
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,417
is like talking to anyone a little different.

605
00:38:08,507 --> 00:38:12,715
Just takes open and respectful communication.

606
00:38:20,677 --> 00:38:22,157
- Hey Bub. - Hey Bub.

607
00:38:22,182 --> 00:38:23,212
- Hey Bubba, hey. - Hey Bub, hey.

608
00:38:23,244 --> 00:38:24,454
- Bub, Bub, Bub, Bub, Bub. - Bub, Bub, Bub, Bub, Bub.

609
00:38:24,486 --> 00:38:26,336
- Hey Bub. - Hey Bub. Hey, Bub, Bub.

610
00:38:26,361 --> 00:38:28,502
- Hey Bub, Bubbybub. - Hey Bub, hey Bub.

611
00:38:28,527 --> 00:38:29,527
- Hey Bub, Bub. - Hey Bub.

612
00:38:30,502 --> 00:38:32,329
- Seen Jesús? - Yup.

613
00:38:39,124 --> 00:38:41,434
And now, we leave town.

614
00:38:56,715 --> 00:38:58,721
Thank you for this.

615
00:38:59,242 --> 00:39:00,440
Happy anniversary.

616
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:03,095
Oh? It's your anniversary?

617
00:39:04,335 --> 00:39:07,105
♪ This is the night ♪

618
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:15,417
♪ It's a beautiful night, and we call it bella notte ♪

619
00:39:22,752 --> 00:39:24,832
How are we gonna find them now?

620
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,883
Thanks, seal.

621
00:39:35,622 --> 00:39:37,081
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

622
00:39:39,315 --> 00:39:40,801
Just a little farther.

623
00:39:40,801 --> 00:39:45,265
Jesús and all the answers you'll ever need are right here at the end

624
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:48,103
of this very scary dark hallway.

625
00:39:48,189 --> 00:39:52,189
Boy, this is so much better than sitting on a beach on Outback Island

626
00:39:52,228 --> 00:39:54,163
sipping piña koalas.

627
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:59,915
We are not skipping town when there is an innocent snake out there who needs us.

628
00:40:00,095 --> 00:40:01,575
He's got help.

629
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,140
His motorcycle buddy.

630
00:40:04,533 --> 00:40:05,812
You are acting weird.

631
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:06,986
What is your problem?

632
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:12,329
Well, A, you railroaded me, and B, if you must know,

633
00:40:12,681 --> 00:40:17,123
I have an aversion to reptiles.

634
00:40:17,979 --> 00:40:18,681
What?

635
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,681
Oh, is my discomfort hilarious to you?

636
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,451
Y-No, you- I'm sorry, you're right.

637
00:40:24,572 --> 00:40:27,236
We are partners, and whenever I'm uncomfortable

638
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,902
you are always very considerate of my feelings.

639
00:40:29,936 --> 00:40:30,963
Look out, snake skin!

640
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,611
I'm slipping, I'm slipping, I'm slipping, hold the rail!

641
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:35,009
- Hold the rail, hold it, hold it. - I'm holding it.

642
00:40:35,054 --> 00:40:36,382
- Stop pulling my ears! - Hold it, hold it!

643
00:40:36,407 --> 00:40:38,755
- Never pull a bunny's ears! - Hold the rail!

644
00:40:41,844 --> 00:40:44,042
I think the real mystery

645
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,642
is how you two ever solved anything!

646
00:40:48,107 --> 00:40:50,787
Anywho, let's see what Jesús has to say about your journal.

647
00:40:50,914 --> 00:40:53,490
Oh, and if he offers you food, accept.

648
00:40:54,526 --> 00:40:57,401
Declining is a sign of disrespect. To all of them.

649
00:40:57,709 --> 00:40:59,271
All of them?

650
00:41:23,021 --> 00:41:23,868
Order up.

651
00:41:25,615 --> 00:41:26,907
Hey, another drink.

652
00:41:33,586 --> 00:41:34,986
So warm.

653
00:41:37,807 --> 00:41:38,563
Whoops.

654
00:41:42,732 --> 00:41:43,746
Keep it.

655
00:41:47,678 --> 00:41:49,151
Jesús!

656
00:41:50,253 --> 00:41:52,064
Allow me to introduce my friends,

657
00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:53,741
this is Judith and Nicholas,

658
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:56,595
they are wanted fugitives investigating a snake mystery

659
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:59,290
and trying not to get murdered. May we sit?

660
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:03,998
Okay.

661
00:42:10,665 --> 00:42:12,900
Oh I'm good, but these guys look hungry.

662
00:42:17,044 --> 00:42:18,519
Thank you for meeting with us.

663
00:42:18,614 --> 00:42:21,740
We believe snakes were framed for something in this journal

664
00:42:21,985 --> 00:42:24,035
- perhaps pertaining to- - Eat first.

665
00:42:24,391 --> 00:42:25,966
Talk second.

666
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:27,003
Oh.

667
00:43:02,768 --> 00:43:04,727
Hey guys, they ate it!

668
00:43:06,144 --> 00:43:07,198
Look at their faces!

669
00:43:08,001 --> 00:43:09,542
I don't eat grubs.

670
00:43:09,609 --> 00:43:11,634
Hermano, get me a scone.

671
00:43:12,862 --> 00:43:14,112
Okay, okay.

672
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:18,467
Metal cover.

673
00:43:19,981 --> 00:43:21,517
And what does that mean?

674
00:43:21,656 --> 00:43:25,119
It means it's fancy.

675
00:43:26,146 --> 00:43:31,486
It also means the secret you're looking for is probably right on the cover.

676
00:43:31,873 --> 00:43:36,940
Somehow vipers can see things in the middle, even under the paint.

677
00:43:37,529 --> 00:43:41,025
This is Ebonezer Lynxley's original journal for the weather walls.

678
00:43:41,212 --> 00:43:44,951
Why would he hide a secret for a snake?

679
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:50,425
I don't know, but it must have been big cause a tortoise died for it.

680
00:43:50,632 --> 00:43:54,365
I am guessing that it was a slow death.

681
00:43:57,641 --> 00:44:01,458
The fanging didn't just change how folks saw snakes.

682
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,273
No mammals trusted any reptile after that.

683
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:08,637
That's why we all left.

684
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:13,939
And that's when the Lynxleys expanded Tundratown the first time.

685
00:44:14,836 --> 00:44:16,711
And it's happening again.

686
00:44:18,175 --> 00:44:20,698
The expansion is going here.

687
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,091
Marsh Market will be buried in snow.

688
00:44:25,101 --> 00:44:26,875
We'll all get pushed out.

689
00:44:27,861 --> 00:44:33,353
Those lynxes will get more land, and there's no way to stop them.

690
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,804
What if the secret hidden in here could?

691
00:44:43,725 --> 00:44:50,087
Then I would say holding it puts the two of you in grave danger.

692
00:44:57,701 --> 00:44:59,442
They tracked you?

693
00:45:01,141 --> 00:45:01,810
Whoops.

694
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:05,725
It's the ZPD!

695
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:10,911
Follow me.

696
00:45:11,021 --> 00:45:11,923
Come on.

697
00:45:14,614 --> 00:45:16,673
Wait, why are you helping us?

698
00:45:16,796 --> 00:45:18,837
You two saved this city once.

699
00:45:19,017 --> 00:45:20,981
I reckon you can save it again.

700
00:45:21,274 --> 00:45:26,605
And when you do, maybe everyone'll see we ain't that different.

701
00:45:32,528 --> 00:45:33,228
Freeze!

702
00:45:33,736 --> 00:45:34,384
Freeze!

703
00:45:35,295 --> 00:45:38,573
I'm really sorry, but this is my family's only chance to come home.

704
00:45:38,598 --> 00:45:39,820
Wait, we wanna help!

705
00:45:40,058 --> 00:45:41,058
Wait, wait!

706
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,157
Come back!

707
00:45:43,979 --> 00:45:45,759
There's no path. Take the docks.

708
00:45:46,032 --> 00:45:46,446
What?

709
00:45:46,941 --> 00:45:47,875
- Carrots! - Wait!

710
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,961
We believe you!

711
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,407
Nick, come on, come on.

712
00:46:02,189 --> 00:46:02,916
Grab it!

713
00:46:10,073 --> 00:46:11,337
I got eyes on them!

714
00:46:11,362 --> 00:46:13,767
- They're heading for the tubes! - In pursuit.

715
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:31,736
- Hey Bubba. - Hey Bub.

716
00:46:31,773 --> 00:46:33,773
- Hey Bub. - Hey Bub.

717
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:34,845
Go!

718
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,168
- Hey Bub. - Bye-bye.

719
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:49,616
One tip.

720
00:46:49,689 --> 00:46:53,294
If he goes for the red line, do not follow!

721
00:46:53,494 --> 00:46:56,909
You will run out of air. Good luck.

722
00:46:56,973 --> 00:46:58,148
I love you!

723
00:47:04,973 --> 00:47:06,275
Cannonball!

724
00:47:09,057 --> 00:47:10,790
No, that's a red line. Red line, red line!

725
00:47:10,815 --> 00:47:11,775
You're gonna run out of air!

726
00:47:11,851 --> 00:47:13,366
Coconut, coconut!

727
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:35,893
Anything you need, I got 'em!

728
00:47:35,997 --> 00:47:37,732
Sequels, prequels, requels.

729
00:47:37,757 --> 00:47:40,134
Who says the industry's going down the tube?

730
00:48:32,614 --> 00:48:34,657
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

731
00:48:35,233 --> 00:48:35,663
Yes.

732
00:48:36,769 --> 00:48:37,347
You?

733
00:48:38,485 --> 00:48:41,811
Well, I-I feel like some...

734
00:48:42,273 --> 00:48:44,528
Some sorries may be in order.

735
00:48:45,292 --> 00:48:47,111
Nick, it's okay.

736
00:48:47,845 --> 00:48:50,032
I know you didn't want to lose him on purpose.

737
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,144
Oh, not me sorry. No, no.

738
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,750
You sorry.

739
00:48:56,591 --> 00:49:01,714
Well, now we kinda have no way to find him or stop the lynxes, so...

740
00:49:02,047 --> 00:49:03,327
Agree to disagree.

741
00:49:04,323 --> 00:49:06,798
But we are alive.

742
00:49:07,066 --> 00:49:09,525
So if we can't find him, that's great.

743
00:49:09,693 --> 00:49:12,478
What we can find is a truck out of here.

744
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:29,071
Box of old matches. Helpful.

745
00:49:29,501 --> 00:49:33,296
Trudy Cabbagepatch, leaving town. We're done.

746
00:49:33,773 --> 00:49:35,316
Yodelay hee-hoo!

747
00:49:36,137 --> 00:49:39,150
- This is weird place for you to be. - Ja, very weird.

748
00:49:39,213 --> 00:49:41,019
You there fell out of the tube.

749
00:49:41,175 --> 00:49:42,969
Okay, we will call police to help.

750
00:49:42,994 --> 00:49:44,587
No! No, no, we're fine.

751
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:46,606
Yeah, but we were just leaving town.

752
00:49:46,787 --> 00:49:51,423
Actually, um, do you happen to know where this tube goes?

753
00:49:51,487 --> 00:49:53,552
- Copenhoofen. - Ja, is Copenhoofen.

754
00:49:53,647 --> 00:49:54,769
Got it, thank y-

755
00:49:55,218 --> 00:49:57,942
Ah, you chew too much, this is not-

756
00:50:03,658 --> 00:50:05,915
Where did- Where did you find these flowers?

757
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:08,814
Oh, the Liebchen flower? At the tippity-top of the mountain.

758
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:10,470
This is only place they grow.

759
00:50:10,572 --> 00:50:11,384
Oh, boy.

760
00:50:11,479 --> 00:50:12,004
Is...

761
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:17,473
- Is there anything else up there? - Nope, there sure isn't.

762
00:50:17,498 --> 00:50:19,673
Oh ja, old Honeymoon Lodge.

763
00:50:19,811 --> 00:50:22,837
What is closed for a long time was hideout for snakes.

764
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:26,173
Honeymoon Lodge!

765
00:50:26,243 --> 00:50:29,075
How- How do you reach it?

766
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:34,058
- Oh, tourist takes the tram from Copenhoofen. - But the rope is faster!

767
00:50:35,048 --> 00:50:36,111
Good luck!

768
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,986
- Have fun at the Honeymoon Lodge! - Thank you!

769
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:49,336
What does this secret have to do with the reptiles leaving town?

770
00:50:51,026 --> 00:50:53,144
How did it get hidden in the journal in the first place?

771
00:50:53,193 --> 00:50:54,957
Will you slow down?

772
00:50:57,376 --> 00:50:59,774
How long do you think it's gonna be before Hoggbottom and the ZPD

773
00:50:59,799 --> 00:51:00,974
figure out where we are?

774
00:51:01,185 --> 00:51:03,893
If anything, we should be going faster.

775
00:51:05,107 --> 00:51:06,486
As I always say...

776
00:51:06,511 --> 00:51:09,361
<i>I really am just a dumb bunny.</i>

777
00:51:09,995 --> 00:51:10,829
Nick...

778
00:51:11,243 --> 00:51:15,415
<i>I-I-I really am ju- du-du-du- dumb bunny.</i>

779
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:17,462
<i>Just dumb-du-du-du-dumb bunny.</i>

780
00:51:17,499 --> 00:51:18,697
This was a gift.

781
00:51:18,806 --> 00:51:20,642
To symbolize our partnership.

782
00:51:20,945 --> 00:51:23,204
And it is not appropriate for this moment.

783
00:51:23,444 --> 00:51:24,359
Oh, no, I was just-

784
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:27,775
Hoping to jot down some ideas for what we will put

785
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,691
on our tombstones. I'll start.

786
00:51:29,809 --> 00:51:31,261
"His partner did it."

787
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:34,132
What happened to you that you can't just have a normal conversation?

788
00:51:35,652 --> 00:51:38,911
I will save that for my therapy animal.

789
00:51:39,503 --> 00:51:42,449
Yeah, you need a therapy animal.

790
00:51:42,514 --> 00:51:46,611
Well, you need a herd of therapy animals.

791
00:51:46,644 --> 00:51:49,858
Yeah, you need a whole migration of therapy animals!

792
00:52:23,702 --> 00:52:24,535
Carrots?

793
00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:08,673
Hey, Carrots?

794
00:53:47,459 --> 00:53:49,042
Uh, Carrots?

795
00:53:57,015 --> 00:53:57,720
Carrots!

796
00:54:26,909 --> 00:54:29,789
There was a whole reptile neighborhood.

797
00:54:32,226 --> 00:54:33,268
Their home.

798
00:54:36,447 --> 00:54:38,390
The lynxes just erased it.

799
00:54:38,903 --> 00:54:40,824
This is what they do.

800
00:54:42,288 --> 00:54:43,134
We have to go.

801
00:54:43,166 --> 00:54:46,501
They push animals out with lies so they can have more.

802
00:54:46,526 --> 00:54:47,767
We gotta go, Carrots, we gotta go!

803
00:54:47,792 --> 00:54:49,095
That's what the snake's trying to prove!

804
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:52,067
- The ZPD is here. - What?

805
00:54:52,796 --> 00:54:54,743
No one will believe us. Not without proof!

806
00:54:54,774 --> 00:54:58,392
Leave it! They aren't gonna just arrest us, the lynxes want us dead!

807
00:54:58,417 --> 00:55:00,039
We need it, to solve the case.

808
00:55:00,081 --> 00:55:02,425
- Judy, just- - We have to solve the case!

809
00:55:02,456 --> 00:55:05,007
- Nick! - I don't care about the case!

810
00:55:07,045 --> 00:55:08,931
Judy, it's not worth dying for.

811
00:55:11,805 --> 00:55:15,298
The world will never be a better place if no one

812
00:55:15,323 --> 00:55:17,345
is brave enough to do the right thing.

813
00:55:17,524 --> 00:55:19,655
The world is what it is, Carrots.

814
00:55:19,689 --> 00:55:22,837
And sometimes, being a hero

815
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:26,792
it just doesn't make a difference.

816
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:35,298
I think, uh...

817
00:55:37,725 --> 00:55:38,725
I think...

818
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:41,406
Maybe, maybe we...

819
00:55:44,385 --> 00:55:45,893
are different.

820
00:56:20,764 --> 00:56:22,798
Oh my gosh, I think I just took out a cop.

821
00:56:22,936 --> 00:56:24,554
Uh, sorry sir!

822
00:56:24,733 --> 00:56:25,322
Pawbert?

823
00:56:25,347 --> 00:56:26,921
Yeah, it's, you know...

824
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:29,600
- We're the good guys! - I told you she's helping.

825
00:56:34,841 --> 00:56:35,798
Come with us!

826
00:56:37,943 --> 00:56:39,226
We have the fox.

827
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,001
We have the fox!

828
00:56:41,843 --> 00:56:43,662
They already have your partner.

829
00:56:44,107 --> 00:56:45,790
They can't get you too.

830
00:56:46,667 --> 00:56:47,394
Please.

831
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:49,251
We can stop my family.

832
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:04,611
Judy!

833
00:57:05,951 --> 00:57:06,951
No, no, no!

834
00:57:09,486 --> 00:57:10,166
I got you.

835
00:57:25,774 --> 00:57:26,345
Alright.

836
00:57:27,134 --> 00:57:28,134
Here we go.

837
00:57:55,684 --> 00:57:57,157
You're not dead!

838
00:57:58,294 --> 00:57:59,580
She's not dead!

839
00:58:01,149 --> 00:58:02,231
Sorry! Sorry.

840
00:58:02,391 --> 00:58:04,511
I just got my motorcycle license.

841
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:08,199
Nick?

842
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:12,384
They... They caught him.

843
00:58:16,142 --> 00:58:19,572
But out here, no one's gonna catch us.

844
00:58:24,758 --> 00:58:26,207
Mayor Winddancer.

845
00:58:32,938 --> 00:58:34,079
Where's the bunny?

846
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:35,680
I don't know.

847
00:58:36,664 --> 00:58:40,615
But you know, she's a rabbit, so maybe you can pull her out of your hat.

848
00:58:41,737 --> 00:58:43,167
I'm not wearing a hat.

849
00:58:43,193 --> 00:58:44,500
He's messing with you, sir.

850
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:46,463
I knew that. Get him out of here.

851
00:58:52,952 --> 00:58:55,595
Where are they, Mr. Wilde?

852
00:58:58,724 --> 00:59:00,192
Begin the expansion.

853
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:03,149
Freeze Marsh Market, flush everyone out.

854
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:03,905
No, you ca-

855
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:08,910
Water folk, like foxes, are lesser mammals.

856
00:59:09,404 --> 00:59:15,046
If I say they helped a dangerous snake, no one will care what we do.

857
00:59:16,805 --> 00:59:19,876
You're going to a dark cell, Mr. Wilde.

858
00:59:19,962 --> 00:59:24,995
Just long enough to read the headline of your partner's demise.

859
00:59:27,696 --> 00:59:31,267
You should have left town when you had the chance.

860
00:59:40,255 --> 00:59:40,815
Dad.

861
00:59:41,627 --> 00:59:42,147
Fur.

862
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:45,184
From whoever's helping the bunny and the snake.

863
00:59:47,903 --> 00:59:49,282
Find Pawbert.

864
00:59:51,618 --> 00:59:53,903
Almost to me hideout.

865
00:59:55,274 --> 00:59:57,699
- Snake in the hole. - Yeah, yeah.

866
01:00:00,353 --> 01:00:02,259
We shall succeed, Judy Hopps.

867
01:00:02,856 --> 01:00:06,171
We'll stop the Lynxleys and save your partner.

868
01:00:06,818 --> 01:00:09,106
I'm sorry. You are...

869
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:11,432
Gary. Gary De'Snake.

870
01:00:11,491 --> 01:00:13,936
- And your last name? - De'Snake.

871
01:00:14,425 --> 01:00:16,915
Everything is gonna be okay.

872
01:00:26,506 --> 01:00:29,683
Teaming up with you is very exciting!

873
01:00:30,714 --> 01:00:32,041
Don't worry about my fang.

874
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:34,716
I got my own anti-venom pen.

875
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:36,090
Stops the toxin.

876
01:00:36,289 --> 01:00:38,144
<i>Stab me straight into the heart!</i>

877
01:00:43,002 --> 01:00:44,877
Welcome to my oasis.

878
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:48,077
Away from my evil family.

879
01:00:48,121 --> 01:00:53,355
I like to come here, just kinda veg out, get with all my cat stuff.

880
01:00:53,944 --> 01:00:55,824
No! That's actually vintage.

881
01:00:57,125 --> 01:00:57,958
And you could just not...

882
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,146
No, no, please don't.

883
01:01:00,193 --> 01:01:02,602
- Wow, mammals get the best stuff! - Oh gosh.

884
01:01:02,649 --> 01:01:04,063
- What's this do? - Wait! Not that.

885
01:01:06,102 --> 01:01:08,344
Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off. Turn it off!

886
01:01:09,969 --> 01:01:12,298
So we should probably get to the journal.

887
01:01:13,742 --> 01:01:16,957
How did you become partners?

888
01:01:17,821 --> 01:01:20,837
When I found out the journal was gonna be on display at the gala,

889
01:01:20,976 --> 01:01:24,659
I sent his family an anonymous letter asking to see it.

890
01:01:24,748 --> 01:01:29,581
Luckily, they make Pawbert work in the mail room, so he read it first.

891
01:01:29,804 --> 01:01:32,282
I got him smuggled in from overseas.

892
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:34,027
Seven days in a crate.

893
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:37,881
But if I fix things for my family, it'll be worth it.

894
01:01:38,454 --> 01:01:41,414
Then we'll fix things for your partner, too.

895
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:53,266
Hey, I know coming with us was hard, but we're gonna help your partner

896
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:56,126
the same way we're gonna help the city.

897
01:01:57,218 --> 01:02:01,118
We stop my family and show everyone the truth.

898
01:02:01,955 --> 01:02:02,681
Are you ready?

899
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:05,684
Light the fire.

900
01:02:14,962 --> 01:02:17,774
How much do you know?

901
01:02:17,993 --> 01:02:18,826
Well...

902
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:21,919
That his family was framed.

903
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:25,093
And there's some secret hidden in the metal cover

904
01:02:25,273 --> 01:02:27,392
that only a snake can see.

905
01:02:27,803 --> 01:02:29,511
Not just any snake.

906
01:02:29,726 --> 01:02:32,609
A heat-sensing pit viper.

907
01:02:33,891 --> 01:02:36,433
All it takes is a little warmth.

908
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:38,868
I just don-

909
01:02:39,408 --> 01:02:40,533
I don't understand.

910
01:02:41,707 --> 01:02:45,477
Why would your great-grandfather hide a secret for a snake?

911
01:02:45,972 --> 01:02:48,326
<i>He</i> didn't.

912
01:02:48,872 --> 01:02:49,517
I...

913
01:02:52,524 --> 01:02:54,483
It wasn't his journal.

914
01:02:56,167 --> 01:02:57,746
That's the secret.

915
01:02:58,604 --> 01:03:01,903
Zootopia wasn't created by a mammal.

916
01:03:02,636 --> 01:03:06,326
It was created by a snake.

917
01:03:06,452 --> 01:03:09,264
Gary's great-grandmother.

918
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:15,390
She wanted to make the city a place where all animals felt welcome.

919
01:03:17,815 --> 01:03:22,540
So she invented her weather walls to help everyone.

920
01:03:27,967 --> 01:03:30,180
She just needed an investor.

921
01:03:31,282 --> 01:03:32,735
A partner.

922
01:03:34,376 --> 01:03:38,919
But when my great-grandfather saw what her idea could be worth,

923
01:03:42,692 --> 01:03:46,313
he plotted to steal her plans for himself.

924
01:03:52,902 --> 01:03:54,740
So he committed a murder.

925
01:03:57,486 --> 01:03:59,206
His own maid.

926
01:04:02,187 --> 01:04:04,622
And framed Gary's great-grandmother.

927
01:04:06,286 --> 01:04:10,977
And because she was a snake, everyone believed his lie.

928
01:04:12,684 --> 01:04:13,493
Soon...

929
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:17,165
no reptiles were welcome.

930
01:04:18,402 --> 01:04:19,641
And over time,

931
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:26,977
my great-grandfather buried the reptile neighborhood in snow.

932
01:04:30,173 --> 01:04:35,673
And he died, believing no one could ever uncover his crimes.

933
01:04:36,846 --> 01:04:37,620
But...

934
01:04:39,666 --> 01:04:42,601
He was wrong.

935
01:04:44,348 --> 01:04:45,778
Her original patent

936
01:04:47,013 --> 01:04:48,156
was saved.

937
01:04:49,348 --> 01:04:51,027
That's what you're looking for.

938
01:04:51,161 --> 01:04:52,841
She hid it in her home.

939
01:04:53,777 --> 01:04:57,649
Find her home, find her patent.

940
01:05:06,075 --> 01:05:12,933
We just didn't know where her home was buried until now.

941
01:05:14,114 --> 01:05:15,790
My family's land?

942
01:05:16,205 --> 01:05:21,620
But under all that snow, how... How are we gonna find it?

943
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:23,949
Wait. Clock tower.

944
01:05:24,329 --> 01:05:27,860
Her neighborhood, the reptile neighborhood, had a clock tower.

945
01:05:27,916 --> 01:05:29,556
It lights up like a beacon!

946
01:05:29,624 --> 01:05:32,916
If it wasn't fully buried, maybe we could see it.

947
01:05:33,013 --> 01:05:34,620
Follow it to her home.

948
01:05:34,666 --> 01:05:36,712
Except my great-grandfather turned off the power.

949
01:05:36,752 --> 01:05:40,424
But we have the plans that show us how to turn it back on.

950
01:05:42,224 --> 01:05:45,634
The power switch to her whole neighborhood was in...

951
01:05:46,515 --> 01:05:48,696
- The original control room. - All right.

952
01:05:48,924 --> 01:05:50,364
And where is that?

953
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:54,297
Inside the oldest wall of the city, the Desert-Tundratown weather wall.

954
01:05:54,579 --> 01:06:01,337
We get inside, turn on that switch, light the clock tower - we find her house.

955
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:03,024
We find her patent.

956
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:06,220
And my family is finally coming home.

957
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:08,511
We will succeed, Judy Hopps.

958
01:06:08,582 --> 01:06:11,261
We shall succeed!

959
01:06:14,154 --> 01:06:15,019
I found him.

960
01:06:16,875 --> 01:06:18,155
Get me Hoggbottom.

961
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:24,712
It's Nicholas Wilde.

962
01:06:24,737 --> 01:06:26,264
Big time cop, huh?

963
01:06:26,289 --> 01:06:28,649
I'll see you at the lunch table.

964
01:06:29,179 --> 01:06:31,532
I'm gonna tie your tail in a knot!

965
01:06:31,699 --> 01:06:34,121
- Hoggbottom? - What are you looking at, butt head?

966
01:06:34,313 --> 01:06:36,055
Just- This is a mistake. It's a setup.

967
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,341
It's the lynxes!

968
01:06:37,524 --> 01:06:39,024
Listen to me, please.

969
01:06:39,049 --> 01:06:41,752
I know we have had our differences, right?

970
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:44,746
But, I-I've always respected you.

971
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,231
You don't respect anyone.

972
01:06:49,991 --> 01:06:52,665
Phone. It's Milton Lynxley,

973
01:06:52,846 --> 01:06:54,845
he's got the rabbit's location.

974
01:06:55,012 --> 01:06:57,204
Whatever he says, it's a lie, Hoggbottom.

975
01:06:57,229 --> 01:06:58,816
Hoggbottom, listen to me!

976
01:07:02,558 --> 01:07:06,727
Nicholas Wilde!

977
01:07:08,554 --> 01:07:10,454
What are the chances!

978
01:07:12,305 --> 01:07:14,264
You know, this is my first time in prison.

979
01:07:14,347 --> 01:07:18,337
And I gotta say, their food is on point.

980
01:07:19,486 --> 01:07:20,923
How are you even here?

981
01:07:21,048 --> 01:07:23,712
Destiny! Plus an arrest.

982
01:07:24,494 --> 01:07:26,540
But it looks like Judith got away.

983
01:07:26,662 --> 01:07:30,602
Was that decision mutual?

984
01:07:31,487 --> 01:07:34,594
Oh, sensing in trouble in paradise.

985
01:07:34,689 --> 01:07:35,727
Want to talk about it?

986
01:07:35,755 --> 01:07:38,075
What I want is to get out of here.

987
01:07:38,123 --> 01:07:39,493
Right, your big plan.

988
01:07:39,549 --> 01:07:42,883
Lay low on Outback Island sipping piña koalas.

989
01:07:42,997 --> 01:07:45,991
Except you can't trust koalas cause they got four thumbs.

990
01:07:46,081 --> 01:07:48,344
Did a whole episode about it on the podcast.

991
01:07:48,429 --> 01:07:51,565
It was called "They Got Four Thumbs." But you know what?

992
01:07:51,632 --> 01:07:52,947
At least they ain't platypuses.

993
01:07:53,105 --> 01:07:56,766
Wait, can you just, can you please just let me concentrate?

994
01:07:56,861 --> 01:07:57,821
Roger that.

995
01:08:02,913 --> 01:08:04,845
Just talk to me, dude.

996
01:08:06,181 --> 01:08:08,321
What's the last thing she said to you?

997
01:08:09,508 --> 01:08:12,202
She, um, she said,

998
01:08:12,806 --> 01:08:17,188
"Maybe we are too different."

999
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:21,308
And what did you say before that?

1000
01:08:21,834 --> 01:08:24,274
I said the case isn't worth dying for.

1001
01:08:25,147 --> 01:08:27,743
Like... Like, you know,

1002
01:08:27,778 --> 01:08:32,154
as in it isn't worth her dying for because...

1003
01:08:33,747 --> 01:08:38,758
Because solitary animals like me don't have real friends.

1004
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:41,057
And I... I...

1005
01:08:42,245 --> 01:08:43,438
I don't want to lose her.

1006
01:08:45,182 --> 01:08:46,302
So, I just...

1007
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,205
I don't know how to say that.

1008
01:08:52,207 --> 01:08:52,944
You know what, bud?

1009
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:54,755
I think you just did.

1010
01:08:56,122 --> 01:08:57,359
Wait, how'd you do that?

1011
01:08:57,470 --> 01:09:02,024
Well, I open my arms, put them around you, and then I squeeze.

1012
01:09:02,211 --> 01:09:03,407
It's called a hug.

1013
01:09:03,591 --> 01:09:05,111
Do foxes not have hugs?

1014
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:07,763
Oh, the lock.

1015
01:09:07,838 --> 01:09:09,614
Yeah, that's Beave 101.

1016
01:09:10,134 --> 01:09:11,934
The rabbit's in Desert Dunes!

1017
01:09:12,157 --> 01:09:14,065
- Roll out! - Roll out!

1018
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:17,834
Your partner needs you, and Nibbles Maplestick

1019
01:09:17,859 --> 01:09:19,374
is gonna get you to her.

1020
01:09:20,621 --> 01:09:22,889
Hey, it's the fox dad!

1021
01:09:23,313 --> 01:09:25,540
- And a woodchuck! - Woodchuck?

1022
01:09:25,586 --> 01:09:27,618
I'm a beaver! Call me that again-

1023
01:09:29,015 --> 01:09:29,839
Okay, go! We gotta go.

1024
01:09:29,864 --> 01:09:30,429
Here we go.

1025
01:09:34,454 --> 01:09:36,226
Hello, Nicholas.

1026
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,200
I hope you like my new home.

1027
01:09:38,413 --> 01:09:40,779
I wove it with my own wool.

1028
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:42,438
Jump scare!

1029
01:09:47,512 --> 01:09:48,248
Adios!

1030
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:01,485
We're free!

1031
01:10:03,906 --> 01:10:05,781
Wheels. We need wheels.

1032
01:10:06,321 --> 01:10:06,876
No, no!

1033
01:10:08,227 --> 01:10:09,492
No, no, no, no!

1034
01:10:10,006 --> 01:10:11,141
I'm sorry.

1035
01:10:11,229 --> 01:10:14,251
I do not think we can get to Judy in time to help.

1036
01:10:14,451 --> 01:10:15,343
Unless...

1037
01:10:15,901 --> 01:10:20,354
You happen to know the fastest driver in the history of Zootopia?

1038
01:10:36,628 --> 01:10:39,626
Hey, Flash, Flash, Hundred Yard Dash!

1039
01:10:39,721 --> 01:10:42,533
Partner's in trouble, need to get across town, ignore the laws.

1040
01:10:42,798 --> 01:10:43,673
No...

1041
01:10:46,261 --> 01:10:47,704
problem.

1042
01:10:48,304 --> 01:10:49,133
Let's hit it.

1043
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:54,035
Hey, glad you're here.

1044
01:10:54,306 --> 01:10:57,486
I got to tell you, I'm not convinced a sloth is our most reliable-

1045
01:11:04,422 --> 01:11:06,459
To turn on the clock tower, and light the way

1046
01:11:06,484 --> 01:11:09,608
to your great-grandma's home so we can find her patent, we need to reach

1047
01:11:09,633 --> 01:11:11,587
the power control room, through here.

1048
01:11:11,709 --> 01:11:13,063
But we have to move quickly or we're never going to-

1049
01:11:13,088 --> 01:11:15,446
We shall succeed, Judy Hopps.

1050
01:11:15,475 --> 01:11:18,118
Look, Gary, if we don't overprepare, we're underprepared.

1051
01:11:18,143 --> 01:11:18,823
And I don't...

1052
01:11:20,015 --> 01:11:24,712
My family has been trying to prove we're not what everyone thinks for 100 years.

1053
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:28,094
But even this close, they never want me

1054
01:11:28,119 --> 01:11:30,538
to put the weight of the world on my shoulders.

1055
01:11:31,009 --> 01:11:33,087
Because, I don't have any shoulders!

1056
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:36,862
We shall succeed.

1057
01:11:40,966 --> 01:11:43,006
I got you, rabbit.

1058
01:11:45,172 --> 01:11:48,804
I cannot help Judy if I don't know where she is, which is why I need you

1059
01:11:48,829 --> 01:11:51,384
to get on Paul's computer and track Hoggbottom.

1060
01:11:51,415 --> 01:11:53,110
You are an escaped fugitive.

1061
01:11:53,291 --> 01:11:55,212
I could get fired for even talking to you!

1062
01:11:55,237 --> 01:11:57,813
They're gonna put her to sleep! Do it!

1063
01:11:57,853 --> 01:11:58,402
Okay!

1064
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:03,401
Did you try restarting it? Mm-hmm.

1065
01:12:03,823 --> 01:12:06,180
- Have you tried not being an idiot? - Hey, Paul.

1066
01:12:06,232 --> 01:12:07,641
I got you some donuts-

1067
01:12:09,228 --> 01:12:10,876
- Oh, no. - Thanks, Clawhauser.

1068
01:12:10,916 --> 01:12:13,037
Clawhauser! Location.

1069
01:12:16,443 --> 01:12:17,718
Oh, no.

1070
01:12:18,108 --> 01:12:20,284
I think we're gonna have to go through the festival.

1071
01:12:20,428 --> 01:12:21,503
Festival?

1072
01:12:27,229 --> 01:12:28,776
The phone's the first thing they track!

1073
01:12:29,508 --> 01:12:30,727
Go, go!

1074
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:36,351
- Clawhauser! - I am working on it!

1075
01:12:37,499 --> 01:12:38,913
- Got it! - Great! Great, great.

1076
01:12:38,938 --> 01:12:39,915
- Now... - No!

1077
01:12:51,039 --> 01:12:52,637
What festival is this?

1078
01:13:06,218 --> 01:13:08,192
Come on! Go, go, go!

1079
01:13:09,078 --> 01:13:11,257
We are with you, Judy Hopps.

1080
01:13:13,792 --> 01:13:15,842
We meet again, zebra.

1081
01:13:18,509 --> 01:13:19,829
Here come the horns!

1082
01:13:22,896 --> 01:13:24,034
She's going for the door.

1083
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,840
She's going for the door!

1084
01:13:26,186 --> 01:13:28,309
Clawhauser, we're out of time!

1085
01:13:29,107 --> 01:13:29,965
I got it!

1086
01:13:30,663 --> 01:13:32,311
Desert-Tundratown weather wall, access door.

1087
01:13:32,337 --> 01:13:35,024
Desert-Tundratown weather wall access door, hurry!

1088
01:13:35,141 --> 01:13:37,365
What is in that wall?

1089
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:38,405
A power control room.

1090
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:41,548
But for... like some old part of Tundratown.

1091
01:13:42,063 --> 01:13:43,681
I know what they're doing.

1092
01:13:43,774 --> 01:13:44,988
They'll ruin us!

1093
01:13:48,413 --> 01:13:49,966
No more tranquilizers!

1094
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:51,716
- Put them down. - Sir?

1095
01:13:51,881 --> 01:13:54,225
Put them down now!

1096
01:13:57,626 --> 01:13:59,026
Take the shot.

1097
01:13:59,616 --> 01:14:01,096
Take the shot!

1098
01:14:01,258 --> 01:14:02,391
Do it!

1099
01:14:30,475 --> 01:14:31,105
Judy!

1100
01:14:37,487 --> 01:14:38,487
Power control room?

1101
01:14:38,553 --> 01:14:41,082
Uh, five flights up. Come on, hurry!

1102
01:14:41,528 --> 01:14:44,250
There is a lot of stairs.

1103
01:14:44,812 --> 01:14:47,646
Way to hustle, bud, I love you, I owe you!

1104
01:14:49,994 --> 01:14:52,115
It's turning on. It's turning on!

1105
01:14:54,952 --> 01:14:55,535
Nibbles?

1106
01:15:00,416 --> 01:15:01,108
Nibbles!

1107
01:15:03,513 --> 01:15:04,429
Snake!

1108
01:15:05,774 --> 01:15:06,634
Cold!

1109
01:15:08,321 --> 01:15:10,688
- It's jammed! - Don't worry about me.

1110
01:15:10,886 --> 01:15:12,166
Find the switch.

1111
01:15:13,037 --> 01:15:14,329
No, no, no, no, not these.

1112
01:15:14,415 --> 01:15:15,998
It would be...

1113
01:15:16,318 --> 01:15:17,068
Older.

1114
01:15:33,417 --> 01:15:34,417
Can you see it?

1115
01:15:35,389 --> 01:15:37,074
Did we turn on the clock tower?

1116
01:15:40,686 --> 01:15:41,394
There.

1117
01:15:43,299 --> 01:15:44,365
It's there.

1118
01:15:48,228 --> 01:15:49,270
We did it.

1119
01:15:50,015 --> 01:15:51,765
We can find the original patent.

1120
01:15:53,556 --> 01:15:54,223
Nick?

1121
01:15:55,659 --> 01:15:56,284
The door.

1122
01:15:56,613 --> 01:15:57,613
It's locked. Wait...

1123
01:15:57,957 --> 01:15:58,957
How did it lock?

1124
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:00,020
Nibbles?

1125
01:16:00,516 --> 01:16:01,312
Open it!

1126
01:16:02,844 --> 01:16:03,844
Nibbles!

1127
01:16:05,907 --> 01:16:07,430
Dang door stuck on me.

1128
01:16:08,687 --> 01:16:09,396
Sorry.

1129
01:16:10,025 --> 01:16:12,609
Last case there was kind of a twist.

1130
01:16:13,333 --> 01:16:14,008
I know.

1131
01:16:18,098 --> 01:16:19,829
Oh my gosh, I really...

1132
01:16:19,915 --> 01:16:21,227
Oh, my heart is pounding.

1133
01:16:21,334 --> 01:16:23,361
Oh, I thought you knew.

1134
01:16:23,419 --> 01:16:24,688
I thought you knew.

1135
01:16:26,028 --> 01:16:27,212
Sorry, partner.

1136
01:16:28,982 --> 01:16:30,857
Hate to leave you out in the cold.

1137
01:16:31,198 --> 01:16:33,198
But, I'm gonna...

1138
01:16:34,895 --> 01:16:36,660
Please don't be mad at me.

1139
01:16:37,364 --> 01:16:39,805
But, I mean, you get it.

1140
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:42,441
We've always been on the same page.

1141
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:43,899
Me and you.

1142
01:16:43,972 --> 01:16:45,855
Underdogs, right?

1143
01:16:46,328 --> 01:16:49,009
You gotta prove you're as good as everyone else.

1144
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:50,563
That you belong.

1145
01:16:51,888 --> 01:16:53,930
I know it's messed up.

1146
01:16:54,094 --> 01:16:56,442
But, this is my chance.

1147
01:16:56,848 --> 01:16:58,139
I have to take it.

1148
01:16:58,794 --> 01:17:01,218
Cause when I get to his great-grandma's home

1149
01:17:01,312 --> 01:17:04,229
and I burn the original patent,

1150
01:17:05,107 --> 01:17:07,321
I'll finally be something in my family.

1151
01:17:08,119 --> 01:17:10,520
And I'll finally belong, too.

1152
01:17:10,657 --> 01:17:11,297
Judy!

1153
01:17:15,157 --> 01:17:16,110
Carrots?

1154
01:17:20,582 --> 01:17:21,790
No loose ends.

1155
01:17:24,545 --> 01:17:25,378
Bye, partner.

1156
01:17:29,172 --> 01:17:30,172
Bye, Judy Hopps.

1157
01:17:34,099 --> 01:17:36,313
Pawbert. Please.

1158
01:17:37,116 --> 01:17:40,366
You can be different than your family.

1159
01:17:42,218 --> 01:17:43,593
I don't want to be different.

1160
01:17:48,128 --> 01:17:48,878
Nick.

1161
01:17:51,469 --> 01:17:52,383
Judy?

1162
01:18:00,762 --> 01:18:01,587
Judy?

1163
01:18:02,437 --> 01:18:03,813
Nibbles, do you see her?

1164
01:18:03,868 --> 01:18:05,701
No, nothing yet.

1165
01:18:07,241 --> 01:18:07,866
Judy!

1166
01:18:08,244 --> 01:18:09,119
Ni...

1167
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:11,541
Ni...

1168
01:18:15,407 --> 01:18:19,485
We shall... succeed, Judy Hopps.

1169
01:18:25,317 --> 01:18:26,184
It's okay.

1170
01:18:26,395 --> 01:18:27,395
Judy sent me.

1171
01:18:27,666 --> 01:18:29,845
She needs to find Nick.

1172
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,385
Yep. Should have seen that coming.

1173
01:18:38,445 --> 01:18:39,320
Judy?

1174
01:18:42,442 --> 01:18:43,234
Nick...

1175
01:18:44,376 --> 01:18:45,001
We...

1176
01:18:46,627 --> 01:18:47,544
shall...

1177
01:18:48,816 --> 01:18:50,321
succeed.

1178
01:18:53,277 --> 01:18:53,985
Judy.

1179
01:18:56,117 --> 01:18:59,367
I can't... move.

1180
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:05,574
And you're too cold... to... help.

1181
01:19:06,506 --> 01:19:07,506
And he's gonna...

1182
01:19:09,101 --> 01:19:10,793
Nick's gonna...

1183
01:19:10,911 --> 01:19:11,703
Judy.

1184
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:13,620
The world...

1185
01:19:14,135 --> 01:19:15,260
was never...

1186
01:19:15,373 --> 01:19:16,373
meant...

1187
01:19:16,612 --> 01:19:17,412
to be...

1188
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:20,523
on one animal's... shoulders...

1189
01:19:23,913 --> 01:19:27,274
That's why my great-grandma...

1190
01:19:27,803 --> 01:19:30,053
wanted... Zootopia...

1191
01:19:30,565 --> 01:19:32,323
to be... for...

1192
01:19:32,403 --> 01:19:33,453
everyone.

1193
01:19:34,085 --> 01:19:35,835
So, we could...

1194
01:19:35,966 --> 01:19:39,092
all... help each other.

1195
01:19:40,227 --> 01:19:43,477
I... didn't... help.

1196
01:19:45,546 --> 01:19:46,880
You did.

1197
01:19:47,708 --> 01:19:50,495
You chose... to help...

1198
01:19:50,998 --> 01:19:51,998
me.

1199
01:19:53,712 --> 01:19:54,712
And became...

1200
01:19:55,196 --> 01:19:56,196
my best...

1201
01:19:57,119 --> 01:19:59,953
warm-blooded friend.

1202
01:20:05,151 --> 01:20:07,276
Very warm.

1203
01:20:17,504 --> 01:20:19,879
Permission to hug?

1204
01:20:37,059 --> 01:20:38,392
We're gonna save you.

1205
01:20:38,903 --> 01:20:40,695
And save your friend.

1206
01:20:42,135 --> 01:20:42,885
Judy!

1207
01:20:43,946 --> 01:20:45,715
Hey! He's gonna eat that rabbit!

1208
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:46,493
No, I... Wait!

1209
01:20:46,524 --> 01:20:47,602
I-I'm saving her!

1210
01:20:47,683 --> 01:20:49,144
I'm gonna get her the anti-pen!

1211
01:20:49,169 --> 01:20:50,086
Where is she?

1212
01:20:50,783 --> 01:20:51,837
She...

1213
01:20:52,617 --> 01:20:53,700
She didn't make it.

1214
01:20:54,770 --> 01:20:58,061
But with snake bites you go fast.

1215
01:20:59,568 --> 01:21:00,318
You'll see.

1216
01:21:11,541 --> 01:21:12,208
No!

1217
01:21:17,550 --> 01:21:19,175
She's gone, Nick!

1218
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:21,159
Just, get it over with!

1219
01:21:34,809 --> 01:21:36,143
You're done.

1220
01:21:36,823 --> 01:21:38,712
Know when to quit!

1221
01:21:40,003 --> 01:21:41,003
Anti-venom!

1222
01:21:41,348 --> 01:21:43,265
We can save her with the anti-venom!

1223
01:21:43,402 --> 01:21:44,694
Throw me the bag!

1224
01:21:45,947 --> 01:21:46,689
Judy!

1225
01:22:04,427 --> 01:22:05,010
Leave it!

1226
01:22:05,406 --> 01:22:07,009
You're gonna kill us both.

1227
01:22:07,386 --> 01:22:09,657
It's not worth dying for.

1228
01:22:10,837 --> 01:22:13,357
Agree to disagree.

1229
01:22:24,697 --> 01:22:26,377
<i>Stab me straight into the heart!</i>

1230
01:22:57,290 --> 01:22:58,508
- I was trying to get to you... - I thought that you...

1231
01:22:58,533 --> 01:22:59,446
He told me that you...

1232
01:22:59,646 --> 01:23:00,812
- I saw you... - That you were...

1233
01:23:03,823 --> 01:23:06,338
I'll... help your friend.

1234
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:13,061
Okay, I don't- I don't care that we're different. You know? I...

1235
01:23:13,338 --> 01:23:16,751
What I care about is you.

1236
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:18,220
I care about you.

1237
01:23:20,156 --> 01:23:20,596
Okay?

1238
01:23:22,881 --> 01:23:24,211
And I didn't say it.

1239
01:23:25,055 --> 01:23:29,798
I should have said it, but I didn't because...

1240
01:23:31,768 --> 01:23:35,577
Well, cause I am an emotionally insecure

1241
01:23:35,602 --> 01:23:38,263
source of your discomfort

1242
01:23:38,317 --> 01:23:41,079
who is not good at expressing his feelings.

1243
01:23:42,856 --> 01:23:45,001
Probably because I've been on my own my whole life.

1244
01:23:45,032 --> 01:23:46,040
It's not an excuse.

1245
01:23:46,065 --> 01:23:49,618
It's just... It's why instead of telling you that you're

1246
01:23:49,645 --> 01:23:52,266
the best thing that ever happened to me,

1247
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:55,486
I-I make jokes about your ears, and

1248
01:23:55,522 --> 01:24:01,110
and I tell you that you try too hard when, you know, the truth is I just don't want you

1249
01:24:01,268 --> 01:24:02,907
to get hurt, because...

1250
01:24:04,321 --> 01:24:06,540
Because no one else in the world

1251
01:24:06,813 --> 01:24:10,017
matters more to me than you do.

1252
01:24:12,207 --> 01:24:14,886
I... I do try too hard because deep down I'm afraid

1253
01:24:14,911 --> 01:24:16,126
that I am what everyone thinks I am.

1254
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:18,555
And I suppress my discomfort because I'm worried it makes me look weak

1255
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:20,680
and I want to be strong, and I think I'm failing all the time.

1256
01:24:20,705 --> 01:24:23,704
And I only take what you say personally because you're the only one in my life

1257
01:24:23,729 --> 01:24:27,204
who ever believed in me, even when I don't even believe in myself.

1258
01:24:27,364 --> 01:24:28,770
And I should have told you that.

1259
01:24:29,705 --> 01:24:32,054
No one else in the world matters to me

1260
01:24:32,079 --> 01:24:33,649
more than you do either.

1261
01:24:35,651 --> 01:24:38,040
I have unresolved childhood trauma that I refuse to discuss

1262
01:24:38,065 --> 01:24:39,594
because being vulnerable scares me.

1263
01:24:39,619 --> 01:24:42,040
I make dangerous choices because I have an unhealthy bunny hero complex.

1264
01:24:42,065 --> 01:24:44,899
And I didn't join the ZPD because I wanted to be a cop.

1265
01:24:44,924 --> 01:24:47,852
I joined because I always wanted to be part of a pack.

1266
01:24:48,104 --> 01:24:50,515
And the thought of losing you scares me because...

1267
01:24:51,826 --> 01:24:52,967
Because you're my pack.

1268
01:24:54,435 --> 01:24:55,682
I should never have left you.

1269
01:24:55,715 --> 01:24:57,977
And I do need a herd of therapy animals.

1270
01:24:58,002 --> 01:24:59,384
And I should have told you that you are

1271
01:24:59,409 --> 01:25:02,134
the only partner I would ever want because...

1272
01:25:02,837 --> 01:25:04,253
You're my fluffle.

1273
01:25:06,177 --> 01:25:07,968
That's a bunch of rabbits.

1274
01:25:10,029 --> 01:25:13,344
Now that is what we call an overshare.

1275
01:25:13,636 --> 01:25:16,069
I'm alive, by the way. I made it.

1276
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:18,603
Oh, also, that guy's still alive.

1277
01:25:21,782 --> 01:25:23,461
Hey! Thief!

1278
01:25:23,698 --> 01:25:25,751
He's gonna get to the lost reptile neighborhood

1279
01:25:25,802 --> 01:25:28,124
find great-grandma's patent, and destroy it.

1280
01:25:28,188 --> 01:25:31,823
Yeah, I've got no idea what that means or who Gary is, but let's go!

1281
01:25:32,269 --> 01:25:33,384
Hopps and Wilde?

1282
01:25:33,425 --> 01:25:34,585
Wilde and Hopps!

1283
01:25:34,626 --> 01:25:36,398
And Nibbles and Gary!

1284
01:25:36,633 --> 01:25:37,633
He's Gary.

1285
01:25:39,723 --> 01:25:41,680
Thank you. It's for the snake. He's cold.

1286
01:25:41,705 --> 01:25:43,524
- No fur on him. - Where are you going?

1287
01:25:43,549 --> 01:25:44,386
Bye now!

1288
01:25:47,279 --> 01:25:48,453
- You! - Whoa! Dad!

1289
01:25:48,501 --> 01:25:50,688
- You don't belong in this family. - Wait, wait, wait! Dad!

1290
01:25:50,721 --> 01:25:53,329
- You will never belong in this family. - Wait, wait, wait!

1291
01:25:53,364 --> 01:25:54,606
I wasn't working with them.

1292
01:25:54,631 --> 01:25:56,126
I was helping us.

1293
01:25:57,949 --> 01:26:02,134
I know where the reptile neighborhood is buried, where to find the real patent

1294
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:05,036
that proves that snakes invented the walls.

1295
01:26:05,401 --> 01:26:09,573
I'm gonna destroy it for the family.

1296
01:26:09,757 --> 01:26:11,774
For you, Daddy.

1297
01:26:14,212 --> 01:26:15,930
You want to keep your job.

1298
01:26:15,955 --> 01:26:17,361
You say nothing.

1299
01:26:18,028 --> 01:26:18,821
You!

1300
01:26:19,532 --> 01:26:21,630
Maybe you are a Lynxley.

1301
01:26:21,833 --> 01:26:23,113
Take me to the patent.

1302
01:26:26,268 --> 01:26:31,145
Takes a threesome to be somethin', but a four-way to bust your doorway!

1303
01:26:35,353 --> 01:26:36,602
Get to the patent!

1304
01:26:36,655 --> 01:26:37,735
Destroy it!

1305
01:26:39,855 --> 01:26:41,427
Go! We got this!

1306
01:26:41,924 --> 01:26:44,102
Hi, Whiskers. You're done

1307
01:26:44,127 --> 01:26:45,687
hurting my city.

1308
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:48,563
Uh-oh, tides have turned.

1309
01:26:49,933 --> 01:26:51,668
Hey, Brian Winddancer.

1310
01:26:52,153 --> 01:26:55,899
You want to be a hero or just play one on TV?

1311
01:27:21,798 --> 01:27:23,876
I go left, and you go right?

1312
01:27:23,935 --> 01:27:25,702
Uh, yeah.

1313
01:27:27,858 --> 01:27:29,008
Or...

1314
01:27:43,507 --> 01:27:45,766
You are a horrible driver!

1315
01:27:45,848 --> 01:27:47,188
Yes, I am!

1316
01:28:02,367 --> 01:28:03,372
I'm gonna jump!

1317
01:28:08,798 --> 01:28:09,798
Zoogetherness!

1318
01:28:11,095 --> 01:28:12,946
No, never mind. Forget I said it. Here we go.

1319
01:28:16,165 --> 01:28:17,915
Matches, matches, matches, matches!

1320
01:28:19,854 --> 01:28:22,104
Bunnies, we're burrowers. Rabbit kick!

1321
01:28:26,853 --> 01:28:28,193
I'll destroy the patent,

1322
01:28:28,396 --> 01:28:30,676
that town and everything in it.

1323
01:28:30,849 --> 01:28:36,587
And a dirt bag fox and a dumb bunny will never stand in my way.

1324
01:28:36,708 --> 01:28:39,712
She's not a dumb bunny, and you're forgetting one thing.

1325
01:28:40,059 --> 01:28:41,266
What's that?

1326
01:28:41,311 --> 01:28:42,871
We're friends with a snake.

1327
01:28:43,674 --> 01:28:44,607
Howdy, partner!

1328
01:28:46,344 --> 01:28:46,993
Heads up!

1329
01:28:50,083 --> 01:28:52,551
- Daddy! - Daddy is busy!

1330
01:28:53,035 --> 01:28:54,618
Brian! Go!

1331
01:28:54,759 --> 01:28:57,235
You say justice is dead.

1332
01:28:57,518 --> 01:28:59,950
I say, neigh!

1333
01:29:06,917 --> 01:29:08,389
Here, kitty, kitty!

1334
01:29:09,722 --> 01:29:12,517
- It's called an arrest, sweetheart. - And boom.

1335
01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:22,282
No one will believe you over us.

1336
01:29:23,027 --> 01:29:27,615
We've always been better than you, and we always will be.

1337
01:29:28,265 --> 01:29:31,930
Nothing you do matters.

1338
01:29:33,361 --> 01:29:36,165
Well, it matters to him.

1339
01:29:37,895 --> 01:29:38,776
Shall we?

1340
01:30:48,777 --> 01:30:50,110
One long sock.

1341
01:32:34,073 --> 01:32:37,204
I'm gonna burn it all to the ground!

1342
01:32:37,279 --> 01:32:39,991
I'm a real Lynxley!

1343
01:32:48,579 --> 01:32:50,954
That'll do, pig. That'll do.

1344
01:32:52,391 --> 01:32:53,977
Astonishing news today.

1345
01:32:54,128 --> 01:32:58,943
After officers Judy Hopps and Nicholas Wilde, along with a pit viper

1346
01:32:58,968 --> 01:33:02,063
and a beaver, foiled another major conspiracy

1347
01:33:02,166 --> 01:33:06,673
by revealing the true inventor of the city's weather walls was a snake.

1348
01:33:06,747 --> 01:33:10,485
While the now disgraced Lynxley family were revealed to have stolen

1349
01:33:10,510 --> 01:33:13,186
the original plans and covered it up for decades.

1350
01:33:13,255 --> 01:33:16,274
You have not heard the last of Milton-

1351
01:33:17,176 --> 01:33:21,176
Their Tundratown expansion now officially canceled.

1352
01:33:21,997 --> 01:33:24,292
Some are calling you the dream team.

1353
01:33:24,404 --> 01:33:26,108
How did you do it?

1354
01:33:27,425 --> 01:33:31,187
Well, there's a lot of different animals out there and,

1355
01:33:31,410 --> 01:33:35,524
and sometimes we start to look at all the little reasons

1356
01:33:35,549 --> 01:33:40,401
that we're not the same, and it makes us worry.

1357
01:33:41,491 --> 01:33:47,813
But maybe if we just talk to each other, if we just try to understand one another,

1358
01:33:47,947 --> 01:33:53,157
we would see that our differences don't really make any difference at all.

1359
01:33:53,519 --> 01:33:58,920
Maybe we'd even see that what makes me, me, and you, you,

1360
01:33:59,333 --> 01:34:02,838
can make us even stronger.

1361
01:34:03,558 --> 01:34:07,678
And with hard work, you're gonna get to that by year two!

1362
01:34:07,765 --> 01:34:08,285
Yeah.

1363
01:34:09,101 --> 01:34:09,976
Zebros.

1364
01:34:11,122 --> 01:34:12,674
Actually, my name is Gene.

1365
01:34:13,467 --> 01:34:17,100
My name is also Gene.

1366
01:34:17,332 --> 01:34:18,382
Zebros!

1367
01:34:25,851 --> 01:34:27,340
He did it!

1368
01:34:29,261 --> 01:34:30,781
Kids, get off the snake.

1369
01:34:35,178 --> 01:34:36,618
How's everybody doing?

1370
01:34:37,706 --> 01:34:38,566
One second.

1371
01:34:49,514 --> 01:34:52,139
This is my family.

1372
01:34:52,516 --> 01:34:53,939
Permission to hug?

1373
01:34:58,879 --> 01:35:00,047
Thank you.

1374
01:35:04,337 --> 01:35:05,336
Hey, uh...

1375
01:35:06,022 --> 01:35:07,143
I got you something.

1376
01:35:15,932 --> 01:35:16,977
Love you, partner.

1377
01:35:17,459 --> 01:35:20,750
But I am still me, so I'm only saying it once a decade.

1378
01:35:21,577 --> 01:35:22,694
<i>Love you, partner.</i>

1379
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:24,525
Well, I'm gonna need that back.

1380
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:25,652
I'll give it back to you

1381
01:35:25,923 --> 01:35:27,357
after our next case.

1382
01:35:27,595 --> 01:35:29,011
There's gonna be another case, huh?

1383
01:35:29,299 --> 01:35:30,299
Of course.

1384
01:35:30,512 --> 01:35:31,550
Because when you broke out of jail,

1385
01:35:31,575 --> 01:35:34,050
you also released 200 highly dangerous prisoners.

1386
01:35:34,169 --> 01:35:34,985
Worth it.

1387
01:35:35,690 --> 01:35:37,483
Any idea where you want to start?

1388
01:35:45,703 --> 01:35:49,642
One-way ticket to Outback Island, please. First class.

1389
01:35:49,947 --> 01:35:51,309
Very nice.

1390
01:35:51,876 --> 01:35:54,266
And remember, if you're happy with our service,

1391
01:35:54,299 --> 01:35:57,656
please be sure to leave us four thumbs up.

1392
01:35:57,759 --> 01:35:59,612
Oh, I will.

1393
01:36:05,483 --> 01:36:07,800
- Hopps and Wilde. - Wilde and…

1394
01:36:08,242 --> 01:36:09,201
Cabbagepatch.

1395

Oh, shut up!

01:46:25,803 --> 01:46:28,028
